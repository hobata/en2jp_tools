Notice and Disclaimer of Liability Concerning the Use of IEEE Documents: IEEE Standards documents are
developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the IEEE Standards Association
(IEEE-SA) Standards Board. IEEE develops its standards through a consensus development process, approved by the
American National Standards Institute, which brings together volunteers representing varied viewpoints and interests to
achieve the final product. Volunteers are not necessarily members of the Institute and serve without compensation.
While IEEE administers the process and establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus development process,
IEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information or the soundness of any
judgments contained in its standards.
Use of an IEEE Standard is wholly voluntary. IEEE disclaims liability for any personal injury, property or other damage,
of any nature whatsoever, whether special, indirect, consequential, or compensatory, directly or indirectly resulting from
the publication, use of, or reliance upon any IEEE Standard document.
IEEE does not warrant or represent the accuracy or content of the material contained in its standards, and expressly
disclaims any express or implied warranty, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a specific
purpose, or that the use of the material contained in its standards is free from patent infringement. IEEE Standards
documents are supplied "AS IS."
The existence of an IEEE Standard does not imply that there are no other ways to produce, test, measure, purchase,
market, or provide other goods and services related to the scope of the IEEE standard. Furthermore, the viewpoint
expressed at the time a standard is approved and issued is subject to change brought about through developments in the
state of the art and comments received from users of the standard. Every IEEE standard is subjected to review at least
every ten years. When a document is more than ten years old and has not undergone a revision process, it is reasonable
to conclude that its contents, although still of some value, do not wholly reflect the present state of the art. Users are
cautioned to check to determine that they have the latest edition of any IEEE standard.
In publishing and making its standards available, IEEE is not suggesting or rendering professional or other services for,
or on behalf of, any person or entity. Nor is IEEE undertaking to perform any duty owed by any other person or entity to
another. Any person utilizing any IEEE Standards document, should rely upon his or her own independent judgment in
the exercise of reasonable care in any given circumstances or, as appropriate, seek the advice of a competent professional
in determining the appropriateness of a given IEEE standard.
Translations: The IEEE consensus development process involves the review of documents in English only. In the event
that an IEEE standard is translated, only the English version published by IEEE should be considered the approved IEEE
standard.
Official Statements: A statement, written or oral, that is not processed in accordance with the IEEE-SA Standards
Board Operations Manual shall not be considered the official position of IEEE or any of its committees and shall not be
considered to be, nor be relied upon as, a formal position of IEEE. At lectures, symposia, seminars, or educational
courses, an individual presenting information on IEEE standards shall make it clear that his or her views should be
considered the personal views of that individual rather than the formal position of IEEE.
Comments on Standards: Comments for revision of IEEE Standards documents are welcome from any interested party,
regardless of membership affiliation with IEEE. However, IEEE does not provide consulting information or advice
pertaining to IEEE Standards documents. Suggestions for changes in documents should be in the form of a proposed
change of text, together with appropriate supporting comments. Since IEEE standards represent a consensus of
concerned interests, it is important to ensure that any responses to comments and questions also receive the concurrence
of a balance of interests. For this reason, IEEE and the members of its societies and Standards Coordinating Committees
are not able to provide an instant response to comments or questions except in those cases where the matter has
previously been addressed. Any person who would like to participate in evaluating comments or revisions to an IEEE
standard is welcome to join the relevant IEEE working group at http://standards.ieee.org/develop/wg/.
Comments on standards should be submitted to the following address:
                                Secretary, IEEE-SA Standards Board

Photocopies: Authorization to photocopy portions of any individual standard for internal or personal use is granted by
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., provided that the appropriate fee is paid to Copyright
Clearance Center. To arrange for payment of licensing fee, please contact Copyright Clearance Center, Customer
Service, 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, MA 01923 USA; +1 978 750 8400. Permission to photocopy portions of any
individual standard for educational classroom use can also be obtained through the Copyright Clearance Center.
Notice to users
Laws and regulations
Users of IEEE Standards documents should consult all applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with the
provisions of any IEEE standards document does not imply compliance to any applicable regulatory
requirements. Implementers of the standard are responsible for observing or referring to the applicable
regulatory requirements. IEEE does not, by the publication of its standards, intend to urge action that is not
in compliance with applicable laws, and these documents may not be construed as doing so.
Copyrights
This document is copyrighted by the IEEE. It is made available for a wide variety of both public and private
uses. These include both use, by reference, in laws and regulations, and use in private self-regulation,
standardization, and the promotion of engineering practices and methods. By making this document
available for use and adoption by public authorities and private users, the IEEE does not waive any rights in
copyright to this document.
Updating of IEEE documents
Users of IEEE standards should be aware that these documents may be superseded at any time by the
issuance of new editions or may be amended from time to time through the issuance of amendments,
corrigenda, or errata. An official IEEE document at any point in time consists of the current edition of the
document together with any amendments, corrigenda, or errata then in effect. In order to determine whether
a given document is the current edition and whether it has been amended through the issuance of
amendments, corrigenda, or errata, visit the IEEE-SA website or contact the IEEE at the address listed
previously. For more information about the IEEE Standards Association or the IEEE standards development
process, visit the IEEE-SA website.
Errata
Errata, if any, for this and all other standards can be accessed at the following URL: http://
standards.ieee.org/findstds/errata/index.html. Users are encouraged to check this URL for errata
periodically.
Patents
Attention is called to the possibility that implementation of this standard may require use of subject matter
covered by patent rights. By publication of this standard, no position is taken by the IEEE with respect to the
existence or validity of any patent rights in connection therewith. A patent holder or patent applicant has
filed a statement of assurance via an Accepted Letter of Assurance, then the statement is listed on the IEEE-
SA website http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/patents.html. Letters of Assurance may indicate
whether the Submitter is willing or unwilling to grant licenses under patent rights without compensation or
under reasonable rates, with reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
discrimination to applicants desiring to obtain such licenses.
Essential Patent Claims may exist for which a Letter of Assurance has not been received. The IEEE is not
responsible for identifying Essential Patent Claims for which a license may be required, for conducting
inquiries into the legal validity or scope of Patents Claims, or determining whether any licensing terms or
conditions provided in connection with submission of a Letter of Assurance, if any, or in any licensing
agreements are reasonable or nondiscriminatory. Users of this standard are expressly advised that
determination of the validity of any patent rights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, is entirely their
own responsibility. Further information may be obtained from the IEEE Standards Association.

4. General description
4.3 Components of the IEEE 802.11 architecture
4.3.1 General
Change the third paragraph of 4.3.1 as follows:
It is useful to think of the ovals used to depict a BSS as the coverage area within which the member STAs of
the BSS may remain in communication. In the case of transmissions such as in a directional multi-gigabit
(DMG) BSS, the individual coverage area of a transmission from one member STA to another can be
thought of as a cone and hence is referred to as a directional transmission. The collection of all possible
directional transmissions by a member STA defines the coverage area. (The concept of area, while not
precise, is often good enough.) This area is called the Basic Service Area (BSA). If a STA moves out of its
BSA, it can no longer directly communicate with other STAs present in the BSA.
Insert the following subclause, 4.3.2a, after 4.3.2:
4.3.2a The personal BSS (PBSS) as an ad hoc network
Similar to the IBSS, the PBSS is a type of IEEE 802.11 LAN in which STAs communicate directly with
each other.
In contrast to the IBSS, in the PBSS one STA assumes the role of the PBSS control point (PCP). The PCP
provides the basic timing for the PBSS through DMG Beacon and Announce frames as well as allocation of
service periods and contention-based access periods.
A PBSS can be established only by DMG STAs. Not every DMG BSS is a PBSS. A DMG BSS can be a
PBSS, an infrastructure BSS, or an IBSS.
4.3.4 Distribution system (DS) concepts
4.3.4.3 Robust security network association (RSNA)
Change the third and fourth paragraphs of 4.3.4.3 as follows:
The first component is an IEEE 802.1X port access entity (PAE). PAEs are present on all STAs in an RSNA
and control the forwarding of data to and from the medium access control (MAC). An AP always
implements the Authenticator PAE and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Authenticator roles, and a
non-AP STA always implements the Supplicant PAE and EAP peer roles. In an IBSS or PBSS, each STA
implements both the Authenticator PAE and Supplicant PAE roles and both EAP Authenticator and EAP
peer roles.
A second component is the Authentication Server (AS). The AS may authenticate the elements of the RSNA
itself, i.e., the STAs may provide material that the RSNA elements can use to authenticate each other. The
AS communicates through the IEEE 802.1X Authenticator with the IEEE 802.1X Supplicant on each STA,
enabling the STA to be authenticated to the AS and vice versa. An RSNA depends upon the use of an EAP
method that supports mutual authentication of the AS and the STA, such as those that meet the requirements
in IETF RFC 4017. In certain applications, the AS may be integrated into the same physical device as the
AP, or into a STA in an IBSS or PBSS.

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                                LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 Insert the following subclause, 4.3.4.4, after 4.3.4.3:
 4.3.4.4 Centralized Coordination Service Set (CCSS) and Extended Centralized PCP/AP
 Cluster (ECPAC) within the DMG
 PCP/AP clustering is a protocol between a DMG Synchronization PCP/AP (S-PCP/S-AP) and other DMG
 PCP/APs within the cluster, known as member PCP/APs, and the protocol is used to improve spatial sharing
 and interference mitigation among the DMG BSSs of the S-PCP/S-AP and member PCP/APs. PCP/AP
 clustering allows a PCP/AP within a cluster to schedule transmissions in nonoverlapping time periods with
 respect to other PCP/APs within the same cluster. There are two types of clustering:
    —     Decentralized PCP/AP clustering involves a single S-PCP/S-AP in the BSA of the S- PCP/S-AP.
    —     Centralized PCP/AP clustering is where there can be multiple S-APs in the BSA of any one S-AP
          and all S-APs are coordinated via a single centralized coordination service set (CCSS).
 New architectural entities are introduced to support centralized PCP/AP clustering as follows. A CCSS
 comprises a centralized coordination service root (CCSR) and a set of one or more synchronization APs that
 are stationary with respect to their local environment while operating and are connected to the CCSR via, for
 instance, one of the following:
    —     The wireless medium to an associated STA that contains the CCSR
    —     The DS to an AP (or beyond, to a STA associated to the AP)
    —     A combination of distribution service, portal, and external network
 The CCSR is the entity that provides coordination services for the CCSS, such as selecting the target Beacon
 transmission time of S-APs within the CCSS to minimize interference (see Annex Y for a more detailed
 description of the functions of the CCSR). The CCSR might logically reside within an S-AP or in another
 entity as long as it has a globally administered MAC address as defined in 9.2 of IEEE Std 802-2001. A
 CCSS is suited to an area and a frequency band having propagation characteristics so that the BSAs of the S-
 APs within a CCSS cover the area, yet transmissions within the area are isolated to a high degree.
 An extended centralized PCP/AP cluster (ECPAC) comprises a single CCSS and the set of centralized PCP/
 AP clusters so that each S-AP of a centralized PCP/AP cluster is within the CCSS. The ECPAC also
 includes all STAs within the BSSs of the S-APs and member PCPs/APs of the centralized PCP/AP clusters.
 This is shown by example in Figure 4-3a, wherein
    —     STA3a and STA3b are two STAs coordinated by a one MM-SME component
    —     STA4a and STA4b are two STAs coordinated by a second MM-SME component
    —     The CCSR happens to be located in an external network
 There are no S-PCPs in an ECPAC since a PCP has no mechanism to communicate with the CCSR.
 The CCSS is unrelated to an ESS in the sense that a CCSS might contain whole ESSs, subsets of ESSs, or
 some combination thereof.
 Decentralized PCP/AP clustering does not involve the use of the CCSS, CCSR, and ECPAC entities.

4.3.7 QoS BSS: The QoS network
Change 4.3.7 as follows:
The IEEE 802.11 QoS facility provides MAC enhancements to support LAN applications with QoS
requirements. The QoS enhancements are available to QoS STAs associated with a QoS access point or PCP
in a QoS BSS. A subset of the QoS enhancements is available for use between STAs that are members of the
same QoS IBSS. Similarly, a subset of the QoS enhancements is available for use between neighbor peer
mesh STAs. A mesh BSS is one type of QoS BSS, and it is described in 4.3.15. For a QoS STA that is a non-
DMG STA, Bbecause a the nonmesh QoS STA implements a superset of STA functionality, as defined in
this standard, the STA might associate with a non-QoS access point in a non-QoS BSS, to provide non-QoS
MAC data service when there is no QoS BSS with which to associate. As a mesh STA does not implement
the necessary service, the mesh STA does not associate with any access point.
A STA within a DMG BSS is a QoS STA; hence a DMG BSS is a QoS BSS.
The enhancements that distinguish QoS STAs from non-QoS STAs and QoS APs from non-QoS APs are
collectively termed the QoS facility. Which of the QoS-specific mechanisms a QoS STA supports might
vary among QoS implementations, as well as between QoS STAs and QoS APs, over ranges specified in
subsequent clauses. All service primitives, frame formats, coordination function and frame exchange rules,
and management interface functions except for the Block Acknowledgment (Block Ack) function, direct-
link setup (DLS), and automatic power-save delivery (APSD) are part of the core QoS facilities. A QoS STA

 or QoS AP implements those core QoS facilities necessary for its QoS functions to interoperate with other
 QoS STAs. Functions such as the Block Ack, DLS, and APSD are separate from the core QoS facilities; and
 the presence of these functions is indicated by STAs separately from the core QoS facilities.
 For infrastructure BSS, and IBSS, this standard provides four two mechanisms for the support of
 applications with QoS requirements.
 The first mechanism, designated the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA), delivers traffic based on
 differentiating user priorities (UPs). This differentiation is achieved by varying the following for different
 UP values:
    —      Amount of time a STA senses the channel to be idle before backoff or transmission, or
    —      The length of the contention window to be used for the backoff, or
    —      The duration a STA may transmit after it acquires the channel.
 These transmissions may also be subject to certain channel access restrictions in the form of admission
 control. A DMG STA uses EDCA only within a contention-based access period (CBAP). Details of this
 mechanism are provided in 9.19.2 and, for DMG STAs, additional details are provided in 9.33.4, 9.33.5, and
 9.33.6.3.
 The second mechanism, designated the hybrid coordination function (HCF) controlled channel access
 (HCCA), is not applicable to DMG STAs and allows for the reservation of transmission opportunities
 (TXOPs) with the hybrid coordinator (HC). A STA based on its requirements requests the HC for TXOPs,
 both for its own transmissions as well as for transmissions from the AP to itself.13 The request is initiated by
 the station management entity (SME) of the STA. The HC, which is collocated at the AP, either accepts or
 rejects the request based on an admission control policy. If the request is accepted, the HC schedules TXOPs
 for both STAs (both the AP and the non-AP STA). For transmissions from the non-AP STA, the HC polls
 the STA based on the parameters supplied by the STA at the time of its request. For transmissions to the
 STA, the AP directly obtains TXOPs from the collocated HC and delivers the queued frames to the STA,
 again based on the parameters supplied by the STA. Details of the mechanism are provided in 9.19.3 and
 10.4. This mechanism may be used for applications such as voice and video, which may need periodic
 service from the HC. If the application constraints dictate the use of this mechanism, the application initiates
 this mechanism by using the management service primitives.
 The third mechanism, designated the service period (SP) access or service period channel access (SPCA), is
 applicable only to the DMG STAs and allows for the reservation of channel time by the PCP/AP. A non-
 PCP/non-AP STA requests the PCP/AP for SPs, which can be used for transmission to any other STA in the
 BSS. The request is initiated by the SME of the non-PCP/non-AP STA. The PCP/AP either accepts or
 rejects the request based on an admission control policy. If the request is accepted, the PCP/AP uses the
 Extended Schedule element to schedule SPs for communication between the source and destination DMG
 STAs indicated within the request. Details of this mechanism are provided in 9.33.6.2, 9.33.6.4, 9.33.6.6,
 and 10.4.
 The fourth mechanism, designated as dynamic allocation, is applicable only to the DMG STAs and allows
 for near-real-time reservation of channel time with the PCP/AP. This type of access is used in addition to the
 service period and contention-based access period mechanisms. A PCP/AP can poll a STA and receive
 requests for channel time allocation. Based on the received requests, the PCP/AP can accept a request and
 immediately allocate (within the same beacon interval) channel time for the STA to communicate with
 another STA by using a Grant frame. Details of this mechanism are provided in 9.33.7, 9.33.8, and 9.33.9.
 Non-QoS STAs may associate in a QoS BSS, if allowed to associate by the AP. All individually addressed
 frames that are sent to non-QoS STAs by an AP do not use the frame formats associated with the QoS
 facility.

A QoS STA associated in a non-QoS BSS acts as a non-QoS STA.
Insert the following subclauses, 4.3.17 and 4.3.18 (including Figure 4-10a), after 4.3.15.5.13:
4.3.17 DMG STA
The IEEE 802.11 DMG STA provides PHY and MAC features that can support a throughput of 1 Gb/s and
greater, as measured at the MAC data service access point (SAP). A DMG STA supports DMG features as
identified in Clause 9, Clause 10, and Clause 21. A DMG STA operates in a DMG BSS and supports
transmission and reception of frames that are compliant with PHY specifications as defined in Clause 21. A
DMG STA is also a QoS STA. The basic channel access of a DMG STA (see 9.33) allows it to operate in an
Infrastructure BSS, in an IBSS, and in a PBSS. Certain DMG features such as service period allocation are
available only to DMG STAs that are associated with an AP or with a PCP, while other DMG features such
as EDCA operation in a PBSS do not require association. A DMG STA supports beamforming (BF) as
described in 9.35 and 21.10 and GCM encryption as described in 11.4.5.
A DMG STA supports the PHY signaling as described in 21.4, 21.5, 21.6, and 21.7. At a minimum, a DMG
STA supports the mandatory modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and PLCP protocol data unit (PPDU)
formats described in 21.4 and 21.6. A DMG STA has PHY features that include a low-density parity check
(LDPC) encoding, a preamble making use of Golay sequences, and beamforming. The PPDUs are always
transmitted with the same channel spacing as described in Annex E.
A DMG STA supports MAC features that provide channel access in an environment in which transmissions
use a directional antenna pattern. A DMG STA has MAC features that include frame aggregation, Block
Ack features, service periods, contention-based access periods, DMG protected period, PCP/AP clustering,
dynamic channel time management, reverse direction, spatial sharing, beamforming, and operation (fast
session transfer) in a multi-band device. A DMG STA is not a mesh STA. A DMG STA follows the same
channel access rules irrespective of the type of BSS in which it operates.
4.3.18 DMG relay
The 802.11 DMG relay function allows a source relay endpoint DMG STA (REDS) to transmit frames to a
destination REDS with the assistance of another DMG STA, the relay DMG STA (RDS), as shown in
Figure 4-10a. Relaying can improve the reliability of communication in a DMG BSS in the case the direct
link between the source REDS and the destination REDS has poor quality or is disrupted. Following the
DMG relay setup procedures, a source REDS can discover and select an appropriate RDS to act as the relay
for a particular destination REDS, prior to data frame transmission using the relay. A relay operating as a
link switching type of relay uses the RDS to forward frames between the source and destination REDS if the
direct link between the REDS is disrupted. In a link cooperating type of relay operation, the RDS
simultaneously repeats the transmission of frames between the source and destination REDS, which can
possibly increase the signal quality received at the destination REDS.
4.4 Logical service interfaces
4.4.1 General
Change the second paragraph of 4.4.1 as follows:
IEEE Std 802.11 explicitly does not specify the details of DS implementations. Instead, IEEE Std 802.11
specifies services. The services are associated with different components of the architecture. There are three
two categories of IEEE 802.11 service: the station service (SS), the PCP service (PCPS), and the distribution
system service (DSS). These Both categories of service are used by the IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer.

 This set of services is divided into three two groups: the SS, the PCPS, and the DSS. The SS is part of every
 STA. The PCPS is provided by the PCP of a PBSS. The DSS are provided by the DS.

 4.4.2a PBSS control point service (PCPS)
 The service provided by the PCP of a PBSS is known as the PCPS. Since all STAs within a PBSS can
 operate as a PCP, every STA within the PBSS is capable of providing PCPS should it become the PCP of the
 PBSS. Non-PCP STAs do not provide PCPS.
 The services that comprise the PCPSs are the following:
    a)   Association
    b)   Disassociation
    c)   Reassociation
    d)   QoS traffic scheduling
 PCPSs are specified for use by MAC sublayer entities.

4.5 Overview of the services
4.5.1 General
Change the second paragraph of 4.5.1 as follows:
This subclause presents the services, an overview of how each service is used, and a description of how each
service relates to other services and the IEEE 802.11 architecture. The services are presented in an order
designed to help build an understanding of the operation of an IEEE 802.11 ESS network. As a result, the
services that comprise the SS and DSS are intermixed in order (rather than being grouped by category). The
services that comprise the PCPS are a subset of the services provided by the SS and DSS.
Change the fourth and fifth paragraphs of 4.5.1 as follows:
The IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer uses three four types of messages—data, management, extension, and
control (see Clause 8). The data messages are handled via the MAC data service path.
MAC management messages and MAC extension messages (see 8.3.4) are used to support the IEEE 802.11
services and are handled via the MAC management service path.
Change the last paragraph of 4.5.1 as follows:
The examples here assume an ESS network environment. The differences between among the ESS, the
PBSS, and the IBSS network environments are discussed separately in 4.7.

 Change the title of 4.5.3 as follows:
 4.5.3 Services that support the distribution service and the PCP service
 4.5.4 Access control and data confidentiality services
 4.5.4.2 Authentication
 Change the sixth paragraph of 4.5.4.2 as follows:
 SAE authentication or Open System 802.11 authentication is used by non-DMG STAs in an RSN for
 infrastructure BSS. SAE authentication, Open System 802.11 authentication, or no 802.11 authentication is
 used in an RSN for IBSS. SAE authentication is used in an MBSS. An RSNA disallows the use of Shared
 Key 802.11 authentication. In an RSN for DMG BSS, Open System 802.11 authentication is not used
 (11.1.4).
 4.5.4.4 Data confidentiality
 Change the third and fourth paragraphs of 4.5.4.4 as follows (note that footnote 19 remains unchanged):
 IEEE Std 802.11 provides several cryptographic algorithms to protect data traffic, including WEP, TKIP,
 GCMP, and CCMP. WEP and TKIP are based on the ARC419 algorithm, and CCMP and GCMP are is
 based on the advanced encryption standard (AES). A means is provided for STAs to select the algorithm(s)
 to be used for a given association.
 IEEE Std 802.11 provides the following one security protocols, CCMP, for protection of individually
 addressed robust management frames: CCMP and GCMP. This standard does not provide data
 confidentiality for group addressed robust management frames.
 Change 4.7 and insert Figure 4.13a as follows:
 4.7 Differences between among ESS, PBSS, and IBSS LANs
 In 4.3.2 the concept of the IBSS LAN was introduced, and in 4.3.2a the concept of the PBSS LAN was
 introduced. In an IBSS and a PBSS network, a STA communicates directly with one or more other STAs.
 Consider the full IEEE 802.11 architecture as shown in Figure 4-12.

An IBSS consists of STAs that are directly connected. Thus there is (by definition) only one BSS. Further,
because there is no physical DS, there is no portal, integrated wired LAN, or DSS. The logical picture
reduces to Figure 4-13.
Figure 4-13 remains unchanged.
An important difference between the IBSS and the PBSS is that, within the PBSS, Beacons are not
transmitted by every STA and instead only a single STA, namely the PCP, is responsible for DMG Beacon
frame transmission. Within the IBSS, all STAs are responsible for beacon frame transmission. When
compared to the infrastructure BSS, the PBSS does not provide certain DSSs as described in 4.4.2a.
There can be more than one PBSS in the same BSA. One of the STAs within each PBSS assumes the role of
the PCP. The logical picture of the PBSS reduces to Figure 4-13a.

 Only the minimum two STAs are shown in Figure 4-13. An IBSS might have an arbitrary number of
 members. In an IBSS, only Class 1 and Class 2 frames are allowed because there is no DS in an IBSS. There
 can be no more than 254 STAs associated with a PCP and with a DMG AP.
 The services that apply to an IBSS are the SSs. A QoS IBSS supports operation under the HCF using TXOPs
 gained through the EDCA mechanism. The parameters that control differentiation of the delivery of MSDUs
 with different priority using EDCA are fixed. A QoS IBSS has no HC and does not support polled TXOP
 operation and setting up of TSPEC.
 The services that apply to the PBSS are the SSs and the PCPSs as described in 4.4.2a. A PBSS supports
 operation under the HCF using TXOPs gained through the EDCA mechanism. In a PBSS, the EDCA
 mechanism is used only within CBAPs. The parameters that control differentiation of traffic classes using
 EDCA can be configured by the PCP in a PBSS. The PCP of a PBSS has no HC, but can support TSPEC
 setup, DMG TSPEC setup, and service periods.
 In an IBSS, each STA enforces its own security policy. In an ESS and a PBSS, an AP and a PCP can,
 respectively, enforce a uniform security policy across all STAs.

                 Figure 4-16a—Reference model for supporting multiple MAC sublayers
 An MM-SME coordinates the management of multiple MAC sublayers. Each MAC sublayer has a separate
 MAC SAP and MLME SAP. A MAC SAP together with its corresponding MLME SAP is identified by a
 MAC address.
 Even when coordinated by an MM-SME, each MAC retains its single MAC address, and each STA contains
 a single MAC; therefore, the MM-SME coordinates multiple STAs as well as multiple MACs.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                               Std 802.11ad-2012
Multiple STAs coordinated by an MM-SME have a single PLCP and PMD sublayer that is shared by the
multiple MAC sublayers. Transmission attempts of different MAC sublayers can collide internally if the
STAs share a single PHY, and a backoff procedure is invoked in this case. Since multiple STAs coordinated
by the same MM-SME share the PHY, the STAs do not directly exchange frames with each other.
NOTE—The multiple MAC reference model shown in Figure 4-16a defines how multiple STAs can share the same
physical layer entity. If this model is used in conjunction with the reference model for multi-band operation (see 4.9.4),
the multiple MAC reference model applies within each physical layer entity contained in the multi-band device whereas
the multi-band operation reference model applies to different physical layers.
The MM-SME accesses each of the MLME SAPs of the coordinated STAs separately to deliver MLME
SAP primitives. STAs that are coordinated by the same MM-SME can establish a multiple MAC sublayers
link (MMSL) with a peer STA. The set of all MMSLs between a pair of STAs creates an MMSL cluster.
An MM-SME controls the power management mode, DMG antenna configuration, and other parameters
and states of the coordinated STAs to eliminate unnecessary duplication of functions. A change in the power
management mode of the STAs coordinated by an MM-SME is signaled to a peer STA via any one of the
STAs’ MAC sublayer. Also, a beamforming link established between STAs can be used by all the MAC
sublayers of any of the STAs coordinated by the same MM-SME. For these purposes, a Multiple MAC
Sublayers (MMS) element is used.
The MMS element contains multiple MAC addresses of the MACs coordinated by the same MM-SME. The
element can be included in any frame that advertises the MM-SME capabilities, such as Probe frames and
Information Request and Response frames, and the frames that establish communication agreements, such
as association, ADDTS, and BA request and responses.
4.9.4 Reference model for multi-band operation
The reference model of a device that is multi-band capable (see 10.32) and that supports transparent fast
session transfer (FST) is shown in Figure 4-16b. The reference model of a device that is multi-band capable
and that supports nontransparent FST is shown in Figure 4-16c.

    Figure 4-16c—Reference model for a multi-band capable device (nontransparent FST)
 A multi-band capable device can manage operation over more than one frequency band/channel. The
 operation across the different frequency bands/channels can be simultaneous or nonsimultaneous.
 A multi-band capable device can also support multiple MAC sublayers; in this case, it is coordinated by an
 MM-SME.
 NOTE—For simplicity, Figure 4-16b and Figure 4-16c depict the reference model when there is a one-to-one mapping
 between PHYs and MACs. However, the reference model for a multi-band capable device can be applied in conjunction
 with the reference model for STAs that support multiple MAC sublayers (see 4.9.3).
 The SME of a multi-band capable device contains a multi-band management entity that is responsible for
 coordinating the setup, configuration, teardown, and transfer of FST sessions from a band/channel to
 another band/channel supported by the multi-band capable device. If using nontransparent FST, the multi-
 band management entity can employ a combination of the source and destination MAC addresses in both the
 old and new band/channel to configure the routing of MSDUs and MLME primitives within the STA. If
 using transparent FST, in addition to the MAC addresses, the multi-band management entity can employ the
 TID of an FST session for this routing.
 The multi-band procedures (see 10.32) allow a pair of multi-band capable devices to discover, synchronize,
 (de)authenticate, (re)associate, disassociate, and manage resources with each other on any common band/
 channel that is supported by both STAs.
 When used in the context of FST, the term “session” refers to non-PHY state information that is kept in a
 pair of STAs that communicate directly (i.e., excludes forwarding) and that is available prior to and
 following a session transfer. This state information is different depending if transparent or nontransparent is
 used. For transparent FST, a shared multi-band management entity has access to the local information within
 each SME; and in this case the state information includes BA agreements, TSs, association state, RSNA,
 security keys, sequence counter, and PN counter. For nontransparent FST, the function of the multi-band
 management entity is restricted to coordinating the setup and teardown of a session transfer with no access
 to other local information within each SME. Therefore, with nontransparent FST, any information local to
 an SME needs to be reestablished for the new band/channel, and this can be done either prior to or following
 the session transfer (see 10.32).

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                  Std 802.11ad-2012
By using the on-channel tunneling (OCT) multi-band procedure described in 10.32.4, the SME of a multi-
band capable device can instruct one of its MLMEs to use the OCT services provided by another MLME of
the same multi-band capable device to communicate with a peer MLME of a peer multi-band capable
device. This enables the SMEs of a pair of multi-band capable devices to provide a seamless FST, including
performing (de)authentication and (re)association across bands/channels. The MLMEs that use the OCT
services provided by another MLME within the same multi-band capable device to communicate are
referred to as being on-the-air disabled with respect to each other. Following an FST, two peer on-the-air
disabled MLMEs can become on-the-air enabled with respect to each other.
As described in 5.1.5, a MAC address is not unique within the multi-band capable device when transparent
FST is intended to be used. When transparent FST is used, a single MAC SAP at each peer is presented to
the higher layers of that peer for all the frequency bands/channels that are identified by the same MAC
address at that peer. When nontransparent FST is used, different MAC SAPs are presented to higher layers
since different MAC addresses are used prior to and following an FST session transfer. Therefore, when
nontransparent FST is used, higher layers are responsible for managing the session transition between
different frequency bands/channels.
Each MAC SAP is controlled by a separate and independent RSNA key management entity and 802.1X
Authenticator/Supplicant, unless if transparent FST is used in which case the multi-band management entity
is responsible for coordinating with each of the SMEs to ensure that a single RSNA key management entity
and 802.1X Authenticator/Supplicant are shared among the MACs and that a single 802.1X entity is
controlled.
4.10 IEEE Std 802.11 and IEEE Std 802.1X-2004
Insert the following subclause, 4.10.4a (including Figure 4-23a), after 4.10.4.4:
4.10.4a PBSS functional model description
This subclause summarizes the system setup and operation of an RSNA in a PBSS.
If a non-PCP STA chooses to associate with the PCP of the PBSS, the non-PCP STA establishes an RSNA
with the PCP following the infrastructure functional model as specified in 4.10.3.
If a non-PCP STA wants to establish an RSNA with the PCP without association or if the non-PCP STA
wants to establish an RSNA with another non-PCP STA, it can directly initiate an RSNA authentication with
the peer STA, followed by a 4-Way Handshake. One difference between this model and the IBSS functional
model is that only one RSNA authentication and one 4-Way Handshake are performed between two STAs.
If both STAs initiate an RSNA setup at the same time, the RSNA setup initiated by the STA with the lower
MAC address is carried through, while the RSNA setup initiated by the STA with the higher MAC address
is terminated.
Figure 4-23a shows an example of the RSNA setup in a PBSS. An initiator STA discovers a peer STA’s
RSNA policies through the DMG Beacons from the peer STA if the peer STA is the PCP or through the
Probe Response or Information Response frames from the peer STA. In this example, the initiator STA does
not associate with the peer STA. The initiator STA may optionally perform RSNA authentication with the
peer STA to derive a PMK. A 4-Way Handshake is then started to complete the RSNA setup.

 4.11 Generic advertisement service (GAS)
 Change the third and fourth paragraphs of 4.11 as follows:
 In an IBSS/PBSS, GAS functionality enables a STA to access the availability and information related to
 desired services provided by other STAs in the IBSS/PBSS. Exchange of information using GAS may be
 performed either prior to joining an IBSS/PBSS or after joining the IBSS/PBSS.
 There are a number of reasons why providing information to a STA in a preassociated state is beneficial:
    —    It supports more informed decision making about an IEEE 802.11 infrastructure or PBSS with
         which to associate. This is generally more efficient than requiring a non-PCP/non-AP STA to
         associate with an PCP/AP before discovering the information and then deciding whether to stay
         associated.
    —    It is possible for the non-PCP/non-AP STA to query multiple networks in parallel.
    —    The non-AP STA can discover information about APs that are not part of the same administrative
         group as the AP with which it is associated, supporting the selection of an AP belonging to a
         different IEEE 802.11 infrastructure that has an appropriate SSP roaming agreement in place.

5. MAC service definition
5.1 Overview of MAC services
5.1.5 MAC data service architecture
Change the first and second paragraphs, and insert a new third paragraph in 5.1.5 as follows:
The MAC data plane architecture (i.e., processes that involve transport of all or part of an MSDU) is shown
in Figure 5-2 for when transparent FST is used and shown in Figure 5-1 otherwise. During transmission, an
MSDU goes through some or all of the following processes: MSDU rate limiting, aggregate MSDU (A-
MSDU) aggregation, frame delivery deferral during power save mode, sequence number assignment,
fragmentation, encryption, integrity protection, frame formatting, and aggregate MAC protocol data unit (A-
MPDU) aggregation. When transparent FST is used, an MSDU goes through an additional transparent FST
entity that contains a demultiplexing process that forwards the MSDU down to the selected TX MSDU Rate
Limiting process and thence further MAC data plane processing. IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 may block the
MSDU at the Controlled Port. At some point, the data frames that contain all or part of the MSDU are
queued per AC/TS.
During reception, a received data frame goes through processes of possible A-MPDU deaggregation, MPDU
header and cyclic redundancy code (CRC) validation, duplicate removal, possible reordering if the Block
Ack mechanism is used, decryption, defragmentation, integrity checking, and replay detection. After replay
detection (or defragmentation if security is not used), possible A-MSDU deaggregation, and possible MSDU
rate limiting, one or more MSDUs are delivered to the MAC_SAP or to the DS. When transparent FST is
used, MSDUs originating from different PHY-SAPs go through an additional transparent FST entity that
contains a multiplexing process before forwarding the MSDU to the MSDU rate limiting process. The IEEE
802.1X Controlled/Uncontrolled Ports discard any received MSDU if the Controlled Port is not enabled and
if the MSDU does not represent an IEEE 802.1X frame. Frame order enforcement provided by the enhanced
data cryptographic encapsulation mechanisms occurs after decryption, but prior to MSDU defragmentation;
therefore, defragmentation fails if MPDUs arrive out of order.
When transparent FST is used, the same security keys, sequence counter, and PN counter are used by the
MAC data plane to encrypt the MPDU prior to and following an FST session transfer, and the same security
keys are used to check the integrity and perform the protection of MSDUs. When nontransparent FST is
used, independent RSNAs, security keys, sequence counters, and PN counters have to be established for
each MAC data plane to be used prior to and following an FST session transfer. When transparent FST is
used, a single MAC SAP at each peer is presented to the higher layers of that peer for all the frequency
bands/channels that are identified by the same MAC address at that peer. When nontransparent FST is used,
different MAC SAPs are presented to higher layers since different MAC addresses are used prior to and
following an FST session transfer.

6.3.11.2.3 When generated
Change the first and second paragraphs of 6.3.11.2.3 as follows:
This primitive is generated by the SME to start an infrastructure BSS (with the MAC entity within an AP),
an IBSS (with the MAC entity acting as the first STA in the IBSS), or an MBSS (with the MAC entity acting
as the first mesh STA in the MBSS) or to become a member of an existing MBSS or a PBSS (with the MAC
entity within a PCP). In an MBSS, this primitive starts the process of mesh beaconing.
An MLME-START.request primitive may be generated in an infrastructure BSS or IBSS or PBSS only after
an MLME-RESET.request primitive has been used to reset the MAC entity and before an MLME-
JOIN.request primitive has been used to successfully join an existing infrastructure BSS or IBSS or PBSS.
6.3.11.2.4 Effect of receipt
Change the second paragraph of 6.3.11.2.4 as follows:
If the an MLME of a non-DMG STA receives an MLME-START.request primitive with a BSSBasicRateSet
parameter containing any unsupported rates, the MLME response in the resulting MLME-START.confirm
primitive shall contain a ResultCode parameter that is not set to the value SUCCESS.
6.3.12 Stop

6.3.12.2.3 When generated
Change the first paragraph of 6.3.12.2.3 as follows:
This primitive is generated by the SME to terminate an infrastructure BSS (with the MAC entity within an
AP) or a PBSS (with the PCP entity within the MAC). The MLME-STOP.request primitive shall be
generated only after successful use of an MLME-START.confirm primitive.
6.3.12.2.4 Effect of receipt
Change the first paragraph of 6.3.12.2.4 as follows:
This primitive initiates the termination of the BSS. All services provided by the AP to an infrastructure BSS,
including Beacons, Probe Responses, and access to the DS, are stopped by the termination. All STAs in an
infrastructure BSS are deauthenticated by the termination. In a PBSS, all the services provided by the PCP,
including DMG Beacons, are stopped by the termination. All the STAs in a PBSS have their RSNA
unestablished by the termination.

 unspecified minimum set of parameters (see 9.19.4.3) in the TSPEC in ADDTS Request frame] exactly
 match those of the matching MLME-ADDTS.request primitive.
 For other values of ResultCode received by a non-DMG STA, no new TS has been created. In the case of
 REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES, the TSPEC represents an alternative proposal by the HC
 based on information about the current status of the MAC entity. In the case of
 REJECTED_HOME_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES, the TSPEC represents an alternative proposal by
 the HC based on information received from the SSPN interface. A TS is not created with this definition. If
 the suggested changes are acceptable to the STA, it is the responsibility of the STA to set up the TS with the
 suggested changes.

In the case of REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_BSS_TRANSITION, non-AP STA should retry TS setup
process with the newly associated AP once the transition is done.
If this is the result of a modification of an existing TS, the status of that TS remains unchanged.
For the ResultCode value of SUCCESS or SUCCESS_STA_IN_DOZE_MODE received by a DMG STA,
the DMG TSPEC and the optional TCLAS parameters describe the characteristics of the allocation or TS
that has been created (or modified); and the specified (nonzero) parameters [with the exception of Maximum
Allocation in the DMG TSPEC in the ADDTS Request frame] exactly match those of the matching MLME-
ADDTS.request primitive.
For other values of ResultCode received by a DMG STA, no new allocation or TS has been created. In the
case of REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES or REJECT_U-PID_SETTING, then the DMG
TSPEC, Multi-band, and U-PID parameters represent an alternative proposal by the peer STA. In such
cases, an allocation or TS has not been created. If the suggested changes are acceptable to the STA, it is the
responsibility of the STA to set up the allocation or TS with the suggested changes.
If this failure is the result of a modification of an existing allocation or TS, the status of that allocation or TS
remains unchanged.

Change the second paragraph of 6.3.26.6.4 as follows:
This primitive causes the local MAC entity to send out a DELTS frame containing the specified parameters.
If this primitive was generated at the HC, the frame is sent to the specified STA’s MAC address. If this
primitive was generated at the non-AP STA that is a non-DMG STA, the frame is sent to its HC. A DMG
STA sends the frame to the specified STA’s MAC address. In either any of the cases, the DELTS frame does
not solicit a response from the recipient frame other than an acknowledgment to receipt of the frame.

On-channel tunneling (OCT) primitives are used as part of multi-band operation (see 10.32). OCT frames
are used to transport management frames between peer MLME entities of multi-band capable devices.

                                          Figure 6-25b—Operation of OCT
An initiator MLME of a STA that might not be currently enabled to transmit generates a MLME-
OCTunnel.request primitive to a local MLME entity of a STA that is enabled to transmit. This request
carries the contents of a management frame and replaces transmission on-the-air of that frame.
The recipient MLME generates the MLME-OCTunnel.indication primitive to the local MLME entity
identified in the On-channel Tunnel Request frame.
The direct MLME-to-MLME primitive exchange should be viewed as shorthand for an exchange through
the SMEs and multi-band entity, i.e., an MLME addresses another local MLME entity by sending that
primitive through its SME and the multi-band entity to the SME of the MLME entity of a STA that is
enabled to transmit, which reflects that primitive to the appropriate recipient.

7.3.5.7a PHY-TXPLCPEND.indication
7.3.5.7a.1 Function
This primitive indicates the transmission completion of the PLCP header to the local MAC entity.
7.3.5.7a.2 Semantics of the service primitive
The semantics of the primitive are as follows:
   PHY-TXPLCPEND.indication
This primitive has no parameters.
7.3.5.7a.3 When generated
The PHY-TXPLCPEND.indication primitive is generated by a transmitter PHY entity at the end of
transmission of the last symbol containing the PLCP header.
7.3.5.7a.4 Effect of receipt
The receipt of this primitive by the MAC entity causes the MAC to record the time when this primitive is
received only if TIME_OF_DEPARTURE_REQUESTED is true in the corresponding
PHY_TXSTART.request primitive.

 Insert the following subclauses, 7.3.5.16 to 7.3.5.16.4, after 7.3.5.15.4:
 7.3.5.16 PHY-TxBusy.indication
 7.3.5.16.1 Function
 This primitive is an indication by the PHY to the local MAC entity(ies) of the current transmission state of
 the PHY.
 7.3.5.16.2 Semantics of the service primitive
 The primitive provides the following parameter:
    PHY-TxBusy.indication (STATE)
 The STATE parameter can be one of two values: BUSY or IDLE. The parameter value is BUSY if the PHY
 is transmitting a PPDU and thus not available to respond with a PHY-TXSTART.confirm primitive to a
 PHY-TXSTART.request primitive. Otherwise, the value of the parameter is IDLE.
 7.3.5.16.3 When generated
 The primitive is generated when the PHY issues a PHY-TXSTART.confirm primitive to one of the MAC
 entities coordinated by an MM-SME, and is generated to all coordinated MAC entities except to the one to
 which it responds with the PHY-TXSTART.confirm primitive. The STATE of the primitive is set to BUSY.
 This primitive is generated within aTxPLCPDelay of the occurrence of a change in the state of the PLCP
 transmit state machine to the RX state. In this case, the STATE of the primitive is set to IDLE.
 7.3.5.16.4 Effect of receipt
 The effect of receipt of this primitive by the MAC is unspecified if the STATE of the primitive is set to
 IDLE. The effect of receipt of this primitive by the MAC is specified in 9.19.2.5 if the STATE of the
 primitive is set to BUSY.

 8.2.4.1.8 More Data field
 Change 8.2.4.1.8 as follows:
 The More Data field is 1 bit in length and is used differently by a non-DMG STA and by a DMG STA.
 A non-DMG STA uses the More Data field to indicate to a STA in PS mode that more BUs are buffered for
 that STA at the AP. The More Data field is valid in individually addressed data or management type frames
 transmitted by an AP to a STA in PS mode. A value of 1 indicates that at least one additional buffered BU is
 present for the same STA.
 A non-DMG STA optionally sets Tthe More Data field is optionally set to 1 in individually addressed data
 type frames transmitted by a CF-Pollable STA to the PC in response to a CF-Poll to indicate that the STA
 has at least one additional buffered MSDU available for transmission in response to a subsequent CF-Poll.
 For a non-DMG STA in which the More Data Ack subfield of its QoS Capability element is 1 and that has
 APSD enabled, an AP optionally sets the More Data field to 1 in ACK frames to this STA to indicate that the
 AP has a pending transmission for the STA.
 For a STA with TDLS peer PSM enabled and the More Data Ack subfield equal to 1 in the QoS Capability
 element of its transmitted TDLS Setup Request frame or TDLS Setup Response frame, a TDLS peer STA
 optionally sets the More Data field to 1 in ACK frames to this STA to indicate that it has a pending
 transmission for the STA.
 The More Data field is 1 in individually addressed frames transmitted by a mesh STA to a peer mesh STA
 that is either in light sleep mode or in deep sleep mode for the corresponding mesh peering, when additional
 BUs remain to be transmitted to this peer mesh STA.
 A non-DMG STA sets Tthe More Data field is set to 0 in all other directed frames.
 A non-DMG STA sets Tthe More Data field is set to 1 in group addressed frames transmitted by the AP
 when additional group addressed bufferable units (BUs) that are not part of an active GCR-SP remain to be
 transmitted by the AP during this beacon interval. The More Data field is set to 0 in group addressed frames
 transmitted by the AP when no more group addressed BUs that are not part of an active GCR-SP remain to
 be transmitted by the AP during this beacon interval and in all group addressed frames transmitted by non-
 AP STAs.
 The More Data field is set to 1 in group addressed frames transmitted by the AP when additional group
 addressed BUs that are part of an active GCR-SP remain to be transmitted by the AP during this GCR-SP.
 The More Data field is set to 0 in group addressed frames transmitted by the AP when no more group
 addressed BUs that are part of an active GCR-SP remain to be transmitted by the AP during this GCR-SP.
 The More Data field is 1 in group addressed frames transmitted by a mesh STA when additional group
 addressed BUs remain to be transmitted. The More Data field is 0 in group addressed frames transmitted by
 a mesh STA when no more group addressed BUs remain to be transmitted.
 A DMG STA sets the More Data field as follows:
    —     In directed frames, it is set to 1 to indicate that the STA has MSDUs or A-MSDUs buffered for
          transmission to the frame’s recipient during the current SP or TXOP.
    —     It is set to 1 in group addressed frames transmitted by the AP when additional group addressed BUs
          remain to be transmitted by the AP during this beacon interval. The More Data field is set to 0 in
          group addressed frames transmitted by the AP when no more group addressed BUs remain to be
          transmitted by the AP during this beacon interval.

A DMG STA does not set the More Data bit to 1 if it does not have any MSDUs or A-MSDUs buffered for
transmission to the frame’s recipient during the current SP or TXOP.
8.2.4.1.9 Protected Frame field
Change 8.2.4.1.9 as follows:
The Protected Frame field is 1 bit in length. The Protected Frame field is set to 1 if the Frame Body field
contains information that has been processed by a cryptographic encapsulation algorithm. The Protected
Frame field is set to 1 only within data frames and within management frames of subtype Authentication,
and individually addressed robust management frames. The Protected Frame field is set to 0 in all other
frames, except in Control frames of subtype Control Frame Extension where this field is reserved. When the
Protected Frame field is equal to 1, the Frame Body field is protected utilizing the cryptographic
encapsulation algorithm and expanded as defined in Clause 11. The Protected Frame field is set to 0 in Data
frames of subtype Null Function, CF-ACK (no data), CF-Poll (no data), CF-ACK+CF-Poll (no data), QoS
Null (no data), QoS CF-Poll (no data), and QoS CF-ACK+CF-Poll (no data) (see, for example, 11.4.2.2 and
11.4.3.1 that show that the frame body needs to be 1 octet or longer to apply the encapsulation).
8.2.4.1.10 Order field

 8.2.4.5 QoS Control field
 8.2.4.5.1 QoS Control field structure
 Change 8.2.4.5.1, and insert Table 8-4a as follows:
 The QoS Control field is a 16-bit field that identifies the TC or TS to which the frame belongs as well as
 various other QoS-related, A-MSDU–related, and mesh-related information about the frame that varies by
 frame type, subtype, and type of transmitting STA. The QoS Control field is present in all data frames in
 which the QoS subfield of the Subtype field is equal to 1 (see 8.2.4.1.3).
 When not transmitted within a DMG PPDU, eEach QoS Control field comprises five or eight subfields, as
 defined for the particular sender (HC or non-AP STA) and frame type and subtype. The usage of these
 subfields and the various possible layouts of the QoS Control field are described 8.2.4.5.2 to 8.2.4.5.12 and
 illustrated in Table 8-4.
 See 9.12.1 for constraints on the contents of the QoS Control field when present in an A-MPDU.
 Table 8-4 remains unchanged.
 The format of the QoS Control field for MPDUs transmitted within a DMG PPDU is provided in Table 8-4a.
 Data subtypes not shown in the table are not transmitted within a DMG PPDU.

8.2.4.5.3 EOSP (end of service period) subfield
Change the first paragraph of 8.2.4.5.3 as follows:
The EOSP subfield is 1 bit in length and is used by the HC to indicate the end of the current service period
(SP) and by a DMG STA to indicate the end of the current SP or the end of the current allocated CBAP with
individually addressed destination AID. The HC sets the EOSP subfield to 1 in its transmission and
retransmissions of the SP’s final frame to end a scheduled/unscheduled SP and sets it to 0 otherwise. To end
an SP allocation or a CBAP allocation with individually addressed destination AID, the DMG STA sets the
EOSP subfield to 1 in its final frame transmission and retransmissions within the allocation; otherwise, the
DMG STA sets the EOSP subfield to 0.

                              In a frame that is a non-A-MPDU frame:
                              The addressed recipient returns an ACK or QoS +CF-Ack frame after a short interframe
                              space (SIFS) period, according to the procedures defined in 9.3.2.8 and 9.19.3.5. For a
                              non-DMG STA, tThis is the only permissible value for the Ack Policy subfield for
                              individually addressed QoS Null (no data) frames.
                              In a frame that is part of an A-MPDU:
                              The addressed recipient returns a BlockAck MPDU, either individually or as part of an
                              A-MPDU starting a SIFS after the PPDU carrying the frame, according to the
                              procedures defined in 9.3.2.9, 9.21.7.5, 9.21.8.3, 9.25.3, 9.25.4, and 9.29.3.
8.2.4.5.9 A-MSDU Present subfield
Insert the following note at the end of 8.2.4.5.9:
NOTE—For a DMG STA, when the A-MSDU Present subfield is set to 1, one of two A-MSDU formats can be present
in the Frame Body. The specific A-MSDU format present is indicated by the A-MSDU Type subfield.
Insert the following subclauses, 8.2.4.5.13 to 8.2.4.5.15, after 8.2.4.5.12:
8.2.4.5.13 A-MSDU Type subfield
The A-MSDU Type subfield is 1 bit in length and indicates the type of A-MSDU present in the Frame Body.
When the A-MSDU Type subfield is set to 0, the Frame Body field contains a Basic A-MSDU as defined in
8.3.2.2.1. When the A-MSDU Type subfield is set to 1, the Frame Body field contains a Short A-MSDU as
defined in 8.3.2.2.3. The A-MSDU Type subfield is reserved if the A-MSDU Present subfield is set to 0.

When transmitted by a non-DMG STA, tThe Duration field is set to 0. When transmitted by a DMG STA,
the Duration field is set to the time required to complete the CF-End truncation sequence of which it is part
(see 9.33.8): Duration = (i – 1) × (TXTIME(CF-End) + SIFS), where i is in the range [1,3] and indicates the
order of the CF-End frame in the truncation sequence in the reverse direction (i.e., i=1 corresponds to the
last CF-End frame in the sequence).
When transmitted by a non-DMG STA, the RA field is the broadcast group address. When transmitted by a
DMG STA, the RA field is the MAC address of the STA that is the intended immediate recipient of the
directed data or management frame, or the broadcast group address.
When transmitted by a non-DMG STA, the BSSID field is the address of the STA contained in the AP.
When transmitted by a DMG STA, the TA field is the MAC address of the STA transmitting the frame.

    b)    If the STA is a member of an IBSS, the BSSID is the BSSID of the IBSS.
    c)    If the STA is transmitting a data frame when dot11OCBActivated is true, the BSSID is the wildcard
          BSSID.
    d)    If the STA is a member of an MBSS, the BSSID is the address of the transmitter and is equal to TA.

NOTE 1—The QoS Data and QoS Null subtypes are the only Data subtypes transmitted by a DMG STA.
NOTE 2—The HT Control field is not present in frames transmitted by a DMG STA.
Change 8.3.2.2 as follows (including inserting new text and two new subclause titles):
8.3.2.2 Aggregate MSDU (A-MSDU) format
8.3.2.2.1 General
An A-MSDU is a sequence of A-MSDU subframes as shown in Figure 8-31. Each A-MSDU subframe
consists of an A-MSDU subframe header followed by an MSDU and 0 to 3 octets of padding as shown in
Figure 8-32 and Figure 8-33a (in 8.3.2.2.3). Each A-MSDU subframe (except the last) is padded so that its
length is a multiple of 4 octets. The last A-MSDU subframe has no padding.
Figure 8-31 remains unchanged.

                             Figure 8-32—Basic A-MSDU subframe structure
Two A-MSDU subframe formats are defined: the Basic A-MSDU subframe described in 8.3.2.2.2 and the
Short A-MSDU subframe described in 8.3.2.2.3. Unless otherwise noted, in this standard, the term A-
MSDU applies to both the Basic A-MSDU and the Short A-MSDU. The Basic A-MSDU uses only the Basic
A-MSDU subframe format, while the Short A-MSDU uses only the Short A-MSDU subframe format.
8.3.2.2.2 Basic A-MSDU subframe format
In the Basic A-MSDU subframe, each A-MSDU subframe (except the last) is padded so that its length is a
multiple of 4 octets. The last A-MSDU subframe has no padding.
The A-MSDU subframe header contains three fields: DA, SA, and Length. The order of these fields and the
bits within these fields are the same as the IEEE 802.3 frame format. The DA and SA fields of the A-MSDU
subframe header contain the values passed in the MA-UNITDATA.request and MA-UNITDATA.indication
primitives. The Length field contains the length in octets of the MSDU.
An A-MSDU contains only MSDUs whose DA and SA parameter values map to the same receiver address
(RA) and transmitter address (TA) values, i.e., all the MSDUs are intended to be received by a single
receiver, and necessarily they are all transmitted by the same transmitter. The rules for determining RA and
TA are independent of whether the frame body carries an A-MSDU.
NOTE—It is possible to have different DA and SA parameter values in A-MSDU subframe headers of the same A-
MSDU as long as they all map to the same Address 1 and Address 2 parameter values.
The MPDU containing the A-MSDU is carried in any of the following data frame subtypes: QoS Data, QoS
Data + CF-Ack, QoS Data + CF-Poll, QoS Data + CF-Ack + CF-Poll. The A-MSDU structure is contained
in the frame body of a single MPDU. If encrypted, the MPDU is encrypted as a single unit.

Std 802.11ad-2012                              LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 NOTE 1—The value of TID present in the QoS Control field of the MPDU carrying the A-MSDU indicates the TID for
 all MSDUs in the A-MSDU. Because this value of TID is common to all MSDUs in the A-MSDU, only MSDUs
 delivered to the MAC by an MA-UNITDATA.request primitive with an integer priority parameter that maps to the same
 TID can be aggregated together using A-MSDU.
 NOTE 2—The maximum MPDU length that can be transported using A-MPDU aggregation is 4095 octets for non-
 DMG STAs and 7995 octets for DMG STAs. An A-MSDU cannot be fragmented. Therefore, a non-DMG STA cannot
 transport an A-MSDU of a length that exceeds 4065 octets (4095 minus the QoS data MPDU overhead) cannot be
 transported in an A-MPDU.
 When Mesh Data frames are aggregated, the Aggregate MSDU subframe header includes Mesh DA, Mesh
 SA, Length, and Mesh Control. The A-MSDU subframe structure for Mesh Data is defined in Figure 8-33.
 Figure 8-33 remains unchanged.
 The Mesh DA and Mesh SA fields contain the addresses of the destination mesh STA and the source mesh
 STA, respectively, determined in 9.32.3.
 The Length field contains the length in octets of the MSDU.
 The format of the Mesh Control field is described in 8.2.4.7.3.
 NOTE—It is possible to have different Mesh DA, Mesh SA, and Mesh Control in Subframe Headers of the same
 AMSDU as long as they all map to the same Address 1 and Address 2 values.
 Insert the following subclause, 8.3.2.2.3 (including Figure 8-33a), after 8.3.2.2.2:
 8.3.2.2.3 Short A-MSDU subframe format
 The Short A-MSDU subframe is shown in Figure 8-33a. In the Short A-MSDU subframe, each A-MSDU
 subframe (except the last) is padded so that its length excluding the A-MSDU subframe header is a multiple
 of 4 octets. The last A-MSDU subframe has no padding.
                           Figure 8-33a—Short A-MSDU subframe structure
 The Short A-MSDU subframe header consists of a Length field that contains the length in octets of the
 MSDU.
 NOTE—The Short A-MSDU subframe format is not transmitted by non-DMG STAs.

8.3.3 Management frames
8.3.3.1 Format of management frames
In Figure 8-34 (Management frame format), change the octet range for Frame Body from 0–2320 to
0–2328.
Change the note after the first paragraph in 8.3.3.1 as follows:
NOTE—The maximum frame body size shown in Figure 8-34 is for CCMP GCMP encryption with a maximum-size
MMPDU (note TKIP encryption is not allowed and any Mesh Control field is held within the MMPDU, not as a separate
header). The frame body size might be greater if a vendor-specific cipher suite is used.
Insert the following paragraph after the note after the fourth paragraph (“The address fields for the
Multihop ... in the Mesh Control field.”) in 8.3.3.1:
Within a PBSS, the BSSID field of a management frame is set to the MAC address in use by the STA
contained in the PCP of the PBSS.

 The CC Present field is set to 1 to indicate that the Clustering Control field is present in the DMG Beacon.
 Otherwise, the Clustering Control field is not present.
 The Discovery Mode field is set to 1 if the STA is generating the DMG Beacon following the procedure
 described in 10.1.3.2b. Otherwise, this field is set to 0.
 The Next Beacon field indicates the number of beacon intervals following the current beacon interval during
 which the DMG Beacon is not be present.
 The ATI Present field is set to 1 to indicate that the announcement transmission interval (ATI) is present in
 the current beacon interval. Otherwise, the ATI is not present.
 The A-BFT Length field specifies the size of the A-BFT following the BTI, and is defined in units of a
 sector sweep slot (9.35.5). The value of this field is in the range of 1 to 8, with the value being equal to the
 bit representation plus 1.
 The FSS field specifies the number of SSW frames allowed per sector sweep slot (9.35.5). The value of this
 field is in the range of 1 to 16, with the value being equal to the bit representation plus 1.
 The IsResponderTXSS field is set to 1 to indicate the A-BFT following the BTI is used for responder
 transmit sector sweep (TXSS). This field is set to 0 to indicate responder receive sector sweep (RXSS).
 When this field is set to 0, the FSS field specifies the length of a complete receive sector sweep by the STA
 sending the DMG Beacon frame.
 The Next A-BFT field indicates the number of beacon intervals during which the A-BFT is not be present. A
 value of 0 indicates that the A-BFT immediately follows this BTI.
 The Fragmented TXSS field is set to 1 to indicate the TXSS is a fragmented sector sweep, and is set to 0 to
 indicate the TXSS is a complete sector sweep.
 The TXSS Span field indicates the number of beacon intervals it takes for the STA sending the DMG
 Beacon frame to complete the TXSS phase. This field is always greater than or equal to one.
 The N BIs A-BFT field indicates the interval, in number of beacon intervals, at which the STA sending
 the DMG Beacon frame allocates an A-BFT. A value of 1 indicates that every beacon interval contains an
 A-BFT.

The A-BFT Count field indicates the number of A-BFTs since the STA sending the DMG Beacon frame last
switched RX DMG antennas for an A-BFT. A value of 0 indicates that the DMG antenna used in the
forthcoming A-BFT differs from the DMG antenna used in the last A-BFT. This field is reserved if the value
of the Number of RX DMG Antennas field within the STA’s DMG Capabilities element is 1.
The N A-BFT in Ant field indicates how many A-BFTs the STA sending the DMG Beacon frame receives
from each DMG antenna in the DMG antenna receive rotation. This field is reserved if the value of the
Number of RX DMG Antennas field within the STA’s DMG Capabilities element is 1.
The PCP Association Ready field is set to 1 to indicate that the PCP is ready to receive Association Request
frames from non-PCP STAs and is set to 0 otherwise. This field is reserved when transmitted by a non-PCP
STA.
The DMG Parameters field is defined in 8.4.1.46.

If ECPAC Policy Enforced field is set to 0, the Beacon SP Duration subfield indicates the duration, in units
of 8 μs, of the Beacon SPs in the cluster. If ECPAC Policy Enforced field is set to 1, the Beacon SP Duration
subfield indicates the maximum duration, in units of 8 μs, of the beacon header interval (BHI) of the BSS,
and the minimum duration of Beacon SPs in the cluster (see 9.34.2.2).
The cluster to which the transmitter of the Clustering Control field belongs is identified by the Cluster ID
subfield. The MAC address of the synchronization PCP (S-PCP)/S-AP is the Cluster ID of the cluster.
The Cluster Member Role subfield identifies the role that the transmitting STA assumes within the cluster.
A value of 0 means that the STA is currently not participating in clustering. A value of 1 means that the STA
acts as the S-PCP/S-AP of the cluster. A value of 2 means that the STA participates in the cluster, but not as
the S-PCP/S-AP. The value 3 is reserved.
The ClusterMaxMem subfield defines the maximum number of PCPs and/or APs, including the S-PCP/S-
AP, that can participate in the cluster. The value of the ClusterMaxMem subfield is computed in relation to
the beacon interval value (9.34.2). The value 0 is reserved. Values 8 and above are reserved if the ECPAC
Policy Enforced field is set to 0. The value 1 is assigned to the S-PCP/S-AP.
The A-BFT Responder Address subfield contains the MAC address of the STA that is allowed to transmit
during the A-BFT, if present, that follows the BTI.

 8.4.1.8 AID field
 Change 8.4.1.8 as follows:
 In infrastructure BSS operation, the AID field is a value assigned by an PCP/AP during association that
 represents the 16-bit ID of a STA. In mesh BSS operation, the AID field is a value that represents the 16-bit
 ID of a neighbor peer mesh STA. An AID value is assigned by a mesh STA that receives and accepts a Mesh
 Peering Open frame to the transmitter of the Mesh Peering Open frame during the mesh peering
 establishment process (see 13.3.1). The length of the AID field is 2 octets. The AID field is illustrated in
 Figure 8-42.

Figure 8-42 remains unchanged.
A non-DMG STA assigns Tthe value assigned as of the AID is in the range of 1 to 2007 and is placesd it in
the 14 LSBs of the AID field, with the two MSBs of the AID field each set to 1 (see 8.2.4.2).
A DMG STA assigns the value of the AID field in the range of 1 to 254. The value 255 is reserved as the
broadcast AID, and the value 0 corresponds to the PCP/AP. A DMG STA sets the 8 MSBs of the AID field
to 0.
8.4.1.9 Status Code field
Change the second paragraph in 8.4.1.9 as follows:
If an operation is successful, then the status code is set to 0. A status code of 85 also indicates a successful
operation. If an operation results in failure, the status code indicates a failure cause. The failure cause codes
are defined in Table 8-37.
Change the following rows in Table 8-37, and insert the new rows into the table in numeric order:

 8.4.1.11 Action field
 Change the second paragraph in 8.4.1.11 as follows:
 The Category field is set to one of the nonreserved values shown in the “Code” column of Table 8-38.
 Action frames of a given category are referred to as <category name> Action frames. For example, frames
 in the QoS category are called QoS Action frames. The “Action frame” column in Table 8-38 identifies
 exceptions, if any, that specific frames within a category have with respect to the “Robust” column.

The CBAP Only, CBAP Source, and ECPAC Policy Enforced subfields are valid only when transmitted
within a DMG Beacon, Probe Response, or (Re)Association Response frames and are set as follows:
  —     The CBAP Only subfield indicates the type of link access provided by the STA sending the DMG
        Beacon frame in the data transfer interval (DTI) (see 9.33.2) of the beacon interval. The CBAP Only
        subfield is set to 1 when the entirety of the DTI portion of the beacon interval is allocated as a
        CBAP. The CBAP Only subfield is set to 0 when the allocation of the DTI portion of the beacon
        interval is provided through the Extended Schedule element.
  —     The CBAP Source subfield is valid only if the CBAP Only subfield is 1. The CBAP Source subfield
        is set to 1 to indicate that the PCP/AP has higher priority to initiate transmissions during the CBAP
        than non-PCP/non-AP STAs. The CBAP Source subfield is set to 0 otherwise.
  —     The ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield is set to 1 to indicate that medium access policies specific to
        the centralized PCP/AP cluster are required as defined in 9.34.3.4. The ECPAC Policy Enforced
        subfield is set to 0 to indicate that medium access policies specific to the centralized PCP/AP cluster
        are not required.
The DMG Privacy subfield is set to 1 if dot11RSNAEnabled is true. Otherwise, this subfield is set to 0.

 peer mesh STAs in support of QoS traffic transfer using the procedures defined in 10.4 and 10.23.15.3. The
 element information format comprises the items as defined in this subclause, and the structure is defined in
 Figure 8-196 when the element is transmitted in a non-DMG BSS and in Figure 8-196a when the element is
 transmitted in a DMG BSS.
 A PTP TSPEC is a TSPEC exchanged between two non-AP DMG STAs. The format of the PTP TSPEC is
 the same as the non-PTP TSPEC; hence the element format described in this subclause applies to both the
 PTP TSPEC and the non-PTP TSPEC.

  —     The Allocation ID subfield is 4 bits in length. Traffic streams can share an allocation through
        TSPEC aggregation (see Annex Z). The Allocation ID subfield is used as follows:
        —     When setting up a TS, the DMG STA that transmits an ADDTS Request frame containing a
              TSPEC or PTP TSPEC element sets the Allocation ID to a nonzero value to identify the
              allocation it requires to carry the TS. Alternatively, the same DMG STA sets the Allocation ID
              to 0 to indicate any CBAP allocation with the broadcast AID as Source AID.
        —     When setting up a TS, the DMG STA that transmits the ADDTS Response frame containing
              the TSPEC or PTP TSPEC element sets the Allocation ID to a nonzero value that identifies the
              allocation carrying the TS. Alternatively, the same DMG STA sets the Allocation ID to 0 to
              indicate any CBAP allocation with the broadcast AID as Source AID and Destination AID.
        —     When deleting a TS, the DMG STA that transmits the DELTS frame containing a TSPEC or
              PTP TSPEC element sets the Allocation ID to a nonzero value to identify the allocation that is
              carrying the TS to be deleted. Alternatively, the same DMG STA sets the Allocation ID to 0 to
              indicate no allocation exists to carry the TS to be deleted.
  —     The Allocation Direction subfield is 1 bit in length. It is equal to 1 when the originator of the
        ADDTS Request is also the source of the allocation identified by Allocation ID and is equal to 0
        otherwise. The Allocation Direction subfield is equal to 0 when the Allocation ID subfield is equal
        to 0.
  —     The A-MSDU Subframe subfield is 1 bit in length and contains a value that indicates the A-MSDU
        subframe structure to be used for this TS. The A-MSDU Subframe subfield is set to 0 to indicate the
        Basic A-MSDU subframe structure and set to 1 to indicate the Short A-MSDU subframe structure.
  —     The Reliability subfield is 2 bits in length and contains an expected reliability index. The reliability
        index refers to the PER of the PHY (PSDU Packet Error Rate as in 21.3.3.9). The relation between
        the reliability index and the PER is shown in Table 8-110a.
        The Reliability subfield in an ADDTS Request frame that has the Direction subfield set to downlink
        or in an ADDTS Response frame that has the Direction field set to uplink indicates the receiver’s
        expectation of the PER for this TS. The Reliability subfield in an ADDTS Request frame that has the
        Direction subfield set to uplink or in an ADDTS Response frame that has the Direction field set to
        downlink is reserved. The reliability information is provided by the SME using the MLME-
        ADDTS.request primitive and MLME-ADDTS.response primitives. Together with the link margin
        (9.37) and other implementation-specific information, this value can be used by the transmitter to
        estimate the MCS to be used for this particular TS.

 8.4.2.33 TCLAS element
 Change the first paragraph of 8.4.2.33 as follows:
 The TCLAS element specifies an element that contains a set of parameters necessary to identify incoming
 MSDUs (from a higher layer in all STAs or from the DS in an AP) that belong to a particular TS. The
 TCLAS element is also used when the traffic does not belong to a TS, for example, by the FMS, DMS, and
 TFS services. If required, the TCLAS element is provided in ADDTS Request and ADDTS Response
 frames only for the downlink or bidirectional links. TCLAS element need not be provided for the uplink or
 direct-link transmissions, unless the PTP TSPEC is transmitted to a peer STA via a PCP/AP. The TCLAS
 element is always included when a PTP TSPEC is transmitted to a peer STA via a PCP/AP. The structure of
 this element is shown in Figure 8-199.
 8.4.2.48 Multiple BSSID element
 Change the fifth paragraph in 8.4.2.48 as follows:
 When the Multiple BSSID element is transmitted in a Beacon, DMG Beacon, or Probe Response frame, the
 reference BSSID is the BSSID of the frame. More than one Multiple BSSID element may be included in a
 Beacon or DMG Beacon frame. The AP or DMG STA determines the number of Multiple BSSID elements.
 The AP or DMG STA does not fragment a nontransmitted BSSID profile subelement for a single BSSID
 across two Multiple BSSID elements unless the length of the nontransmitted BSSID profile subelement
 exceeds 255 octets. When the Multiple BSSID element is transmitted as a subelement in a Neighbor Report
 element, the reference BSSID is the BSSID field in the Neighbor Report element.
 Change the first sentence in the eighth paragraph in 8.4.2.48 as follows:
 The Nontransmitted BSSID Profile subelement contains a list of elements for one or more APs or DMG
 STAs that have nontransmitted BSSIDs and is defined as follows:
 Change the tenth paragraph in 8.4.2.48 as follows:
 The Multiple BSSID element is included in Beacon frames, as described in 8.3.3.2, in DMG Beacon frames,
 as described in 8.3.4.1, and Probe Response frames, as described in 8.3.3.10. The use of the Multiple BSSID
 element is described 10.11.14. Nontransmitted BSSID Advertisement procedures are described in 10.1.3.6.

8.4.2.134 Extended Schedule element
The Extended Schedule element is formatted as illustrated in Figure 8-401z. Because the length parameter
supports only 255 octets of payload in an element, the PCP/AP can split the Allocation fields into more than
one Extended Schedule element entry in the same DMG Beacon or Announce frame. Despite this splitting,
the set of Extended Schedule element entries conveyed within a DMG Beacon and Announce frame is
considered to be a single schedule for the beacon interval, and in this standard referred to simply as
Extended Schedule element unless otherwise noted. The Allocation fields are ordered by increasing
allocation start time with allocations beginning at the same time arbitrarily ordered.

 The Allocation ID field, when set to a nonzero value, identifies an airtime allocation from Source AID to
 Destination AID. Except for CBAP allocations with broadcast Source AID and broadcast Destination AID,
 the tuple (Source AID, Destination AID, Allocation ID) uniquely identifies the allocation. For CBAP
 allocations with broadcast Source AID and broadcast Destination AID, the Allocation ID is zero.
 The AllocationType field defines the channel access mechanism during the allocation, with possible values
 listed in Table 8-183i.

 to initiate transmissions during the CBAP allocation.
 The Destination AID field indicates the AID of a STA that is expected to communicate with the source
 DMG STA during the allocation or broadcast AID if all STAs are expected to communicate with the source
 DMG STA during the allocation. The broadcast AID asserted in the Source AID and the Destination AID
 fields for an SP allocation indicates that during the SP a non-PCP/non-AP STA does not transmit unless it
 receives a Poll or Grant frame from the PCP/AP.

8.4.2.135 STA Availability element
The STA Availability element is used by a non-PCP/non-AP STA to inform a PCP/AP about the STA
availability during the subsequent CBAPs (9.33.5) and to indicate participation in the Dynamic allocation of
service periods (9.33.7). The PCP/AP uses the STA Availability element to inform the non-PCP/non-AP
STAs of other STAs availability during subsequent CBAPs and participation of other STAs in the Dynamic
allocation of service periods.
The format of the STA Availability element is illustrated in Figure 8-401ac.

 The Allocation ID field identifies an allocation if set to a nonzero value, and is used as follows:
    —     The STA that transmits an ADDTS Request containing the DMG TSPEC element sets the
          Allocation ID to a nonzero value to create a new allocation or modify an existing allocation.
    —     The STA that transmits an ADDTS Response containing the DMG TSPEC element sets the
          Allocation ID to a nonzero value to identify a created or modified allocation or sets it to zero if
          creating or modifying the allocation failed.
 The AllocationType field defines the channel access mechanism used during the allocation, with values
 listed in Table 8-183i.
 The Allocation Format field values are listed in Table 8-183j.

 The Element ID field is equal to the value for the Channel Measurement Feedback, specified in Table 8-54.
 The Length field for this element indicates the length of the Information field.
 The number of channel/SNR measurements reported, Nmeas, is equal to the number of TRN-T subfields that
 were appended to the packet on which the measurements were performed. If the measurement reports the
 result of an SLS or of an MID, it is equal to the number of frames received during the sector sweep, or the
 number of packets used during the MID subphase.
 The SNR subfield levels are unsigned integers referenced to a level of –8 dB. Each step is 0.25 dB. SNR
 values less than or equal to –8 dB are represented as 0. SNR values greater than or equal to 55.75 dB are
 represented as 0xFF.
 The format of each channel measurement is specified in Table 8-183n.

                                                       measured.
Each channel measurement contains Ntaps channel impulse taps. The channel impulse response reported for
all Nmeas measurements correspond to a common set of relative tap delays. If the Tap Delay subfield is not
present, then the Ntaps channel taps is interpreted as contiguous time samples, separated by Tc. The delay
values in the Tap Delay subfield, when present, correspond to the strongest taps and are unsigned integers,
in increments of Tc, starting from 0. Each channel tap is reported as an in-phase and quadrature component
pair, with each component value represented as a twos complement number between –128 and 127. Unless
all in-phase and quadrature component values are reported as zero, they are scaled such that the two most
significant bits for at least one of the component values equal 01 or 10 (binary).
The Sector ID Order subfield indicates the TX sector IDs corresponding to the SNRs in the SNR subfield
when the SNR Present subfield is set to 1 and Sector ID Order Present subfield is set to 1, in response to a
BRP packet with the SNR Requested subfield set to 1. The Sector ID Order subfield indicates the TX sector
IDs ranked in the decreasing order of link quality, determined in an implementation dependent manner,
when the SNR Present subfield is set to 0 and the Sector ID Order Present subfield is set to 1 in response to
setting the SNR Requested subfield to 0 and the Sector ID Order Requested subfield to 1. The FBCK-REQ
field and the FBCK TYPE field in the DMG Beam Refinement element are used by the transmitter and
receiver to, respectively, request for and indicate the Sector IDs and their order.

 The Activity field is set to a preferred action that the STA sending this element recommends that the peer
 STA indicated in the RA field of the Link Measurement Report frame execute. The method by which the
 sending STA determines a suitable action for the peer STA is implementation specific. The Activity field is
 defined in 8.4.2.144.2.
 The MCS field is set to an MCS value that the STA sending this element recommends that the peer STA
 indicated in the RA field of the Link Measurement Report frame use to transmit frames to this STA. The
 reference PER for selection of the MCS is 10-2 for an MPDU length of 4096 octets. The method by which
 the sending STA determines a suitable MCS for the peer STA is implementation specific.
 The Link Margin field contains the measured link margin of data frames received from the peer STA
 indicated in the RA field of the Link Measurement Report frame and is coded as a twos complement signed
 integer in units of decibels. A value of –128 indicates that no link margin is provided. The measurement
 method of link margin is beyond the scope of this standard.
 The SNR field indicates the SNR measured during the reception of a PHY packet. Values are from –13 dB
 to 50.75 dB in 0.25 dB steps.
 The Reference Timestamp field contains the lower 4 octets of the TSF timer value sampled at the instant that
 the MAC received the PHY-CCA.indication(IDLE) signal that corresponds to the end of the reception of the
 PPDU that was used to generate the feedback information contained in the Link Measurement Report frame.

 The New Band and Old Band fields are used for the signaling described in 10.32.1. Both the New Band and
 Old Band fields contain a Band ID subfield, a Setup subfield, and an Operation subfield.
 The Band ID subfield is defined in 8.4.1.45. If a Multi-band element is present in the frame containing this
 Session Transition element, the Band ID subfield refers to the Operating Class and Channel Number fields
 within the Multi-band element provided the value of both of these fields are nonzero.
 The Setup subfield is set to 1 to indicate that the STA transmitting this element has an FST session
 established with the STA that the frame containing this element is addressed and in the band indicated
 within the Band ID subfield. Otherwise, it is set to 0. Other values are reserved.
 The Operation subfield is set to 1 to indicate that the STA is operating in the band indicated within the Band
 ID subfield. Otherwise, it is set to 0. Other values are reserved.
 NOTE—A STA that is operating in a band/channel is not required to be continuously in the Awake state on
 that band/channel.

 The Element ID field is equal to the value for the DTP Report, specified in Table 8-54.
 The Length field for this element indicates the length of the Information field.
 GroupPairIndex(n) subfields for n=0,1,..,NG-1(where NG=42) indicate DTP groups, which in turn
 determines how pairs of SQPSK symbols are mapped to OFDM tones when DTP is enabled, as described in
 21.5.3.2.4.6.3. Valid values of GroupPairIndex(n) are in the range of 0 to NG-1. Furthermore valid values of
 GroupPairIndex(0), GroupPairIndex(1),..., GroupPairIndex(NG-1) are distinct and therefore represent a
 permutation of integers 0 to NG-1.
 All numeric fields are encoded in unsigned binary, least significant bit first.

 RLS. The Duplex-Mode subfield value is set to 0 if the RDS operates in HD-DF mode. It is set to 1 if the
 RDS operates in FD-AF mode.
 The Cooperation-Mode subfield indicates whether the source REDS sets the link cooperating of the RDS
 involved in RLS. This subfield is valid only when the RDS is capable of link cooperating type and Duplex-
 Mode subfield is set to 0. Otherwise, this subfield is reserved. The Cooperation-Mode subfield value is set to
 0 if the RDS operates in link switching type. It is set to 1 if the RDS operates in link cooperation type.
 The Tx-Mode subfield indicates that the source REDS sets the transmission mode of the RDS involved in
 RLS. This subfield is valid only when the RDS is capable of link–switching type and Duplex-Mode subfield
 is set to 1. Otherwise, this subfield is reserved. The Tx-Mode subfield value is set to 0 if a group of three
 STAs involved in the RLS operates in Normal mode and is set to 1 if the group operates in Alternation
 mode.
 The Link Change Interval subfield indicates when the link of frame transmission between source REDS and
 destination REDS is changed. From the start position of one reserved contiguous SP, every time instant of
 Link Change Interval can have an opportunity to change the link. Within one Link Change Interval, only one
 link is used for frame transfer. The unit of this field is microseconds. This subfield is used only when the
 group involved in the RLS operates in link switching type.
 The Data Sensing Time subfield indicates the defer time offset from the time instant of the next Link Change
 Interval when the link switching occurs. By default, it is set to SIFS plus SBIFS. This subfield is used only
 when the STAs involved in the RLS operate in link switching with Tx-Mode that is 0.
 The First Period subfield indicates the period of the source REDS-RDS link in which the source REDS and
 RDS exchange frames. This subfield is used only when HD-DF RDS operates in link switching type.
 The Second Period subfield indicates the period of the RDS-destination REDS link in which the RDS and
 destination REDS exchange frames and the following period of the RDS-source REDS link in which the
 RDS informs the source REDS of finishing one frame transfer. This subfield is used only when HD-DF RDS
 operates in link switching type.

The MM-SME Power Mode field is one bit in length and is set to 1 to indicate that when a STA advertised in
the MMS element sent by the STA coordinated by an MM-SME moves from the Awake to the Doze state,
then all other STAs advertised in the MMS element sent by the STA move to the Doze state. The STA
coordinated by the MM-SME moves to the Awake state only when all STAs advertised in the MMS element
move to the Awake state. The MM-SME Power Mode field is set to 0 to indicate that when a STA advertised
in the MMS element sent by the STA moves from the Doze to the Awake state, then all other STAs
advertised in the MMS element sent by the STA coordinated by the MM-SME move to the Awake state. The
STA coordinated by the MM-SME moves to the Doze state only when all STAs advertised in the MMS
element move to the Doze state.
The BeamLink Cluster field is one bit in length and is set to 1 if the DMG STA intends to maintain the same
beamformed link for all the links within the MMSL cluster. Otherwise, this field is set to 0.
The STA MAC Address field contains the MAC address of the STA.
When present in the element, the Interface Address(es) field contains one or more MAC addresses that can
be used to identify the STAs in addition to the STA MAC address, coordinated by the same MM-SME (see

The BHI Enforced field set to 1 indicates that a PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster completes the
BHI for the current beacon interval before TBTT + 8/1024×Beacon SP duration, as described in 9.34.3.4.
The BHI Enforced field set to 0 indicates that a PCP/AP within a cluster does not have to complete the BHI
for the current beacon interval before TBTT + 8/1024×Beacon SP duration.
The TXSS CBAP Enforced field set to 1 indicates that a STA within a centralized PCP/AP cluster performs
each of its TXSSs in the DTI within one or more TXSS CBAPs, as described in 9.34.3.4. The TXSS CBAP
Enforced field set to 0 indicates that a STA within a centralized PCP/AP cluster does not have to perform
each of its TXSSs in the DTI within one or more TXSS CBAPs.
The Protected Period Enforced field indicates that every scheduled SP in the BSS is a DMG Protected
Period as specified in 9.33.6.6. The Protected Period Enforced field set to 0 indicates that a scheduled SP in
the BSS does not have to be a DMG Protected Period.
The CCSR ID field is set to the MAC address of the CCSR within the ECPAC that the PCP/AP belongs to.
The PCP/AP is the transmitter of the frame containing the ECPAC Policy element except when the ECPAC
Policy element is transmitted in a Cluster Report element, where the PCP/AP is the transmitter that triggered
the Cluster Report.
The Available Time Cluster Offset Bitmap field is a bitmap where the bit n-1, n = 1 to 32, indicates the
availability of the nth Beacon SP. Values of n = 1 and greater than ClusterMaxMem are reserved (i.e., bit 0
and bits ClusterMaxMem+1 to 31 inclusive). Bit n-1 set to 0 indicates that ClusterTimeOffsetn-1 is
determined to be already in use by a neighboring PCP/AP, excluding the recipient if sent within an
individually addressed frame, in the ECPAC. Bit n-1 set to 1 indicates that ClusterTimeOffsetn-1 is not
determined to be already in use by a neighboring PCP/AP, excluding the recipient if sent within an
individually addressed frame, in the ECPAC.
If TXSS CBAP Enforced field is set to 0, then the TXSS CBAP Offset field, the TXSS CBAP Duration
field, and the TXSS CBAP MaxMem field are not present in the element; otherwise, they are present in the
element.
The TXSS CBAP Offset field is the delay of the first TXSS CBAP in a beacon interval from the TBTT, in
units of 8 μs.
The TXSS CBAP Duration field indicates the duration, in units of 8 μs, of each TXSS CBAP, in units of
8 μs.
The TXSS CBAP MaxMem field is the number of TXSS CBAPs per beacon interval.

 Sequence Generator 1 is shown in Figure 8-401bn and is defined as follows:
    —     Generate the sector IDs for subsequent DMG Beacons by advancing the Sequence Generator 1,
          which is initialized using Tap 1 and State 1 contained in the Antenna Sector ID Pattern element
          received from the PCP/AP.
    —     Advance the Sequence Generator 1 by one shift for each anticipated DMG Beacon transmission
          thereafter.
    —     After advancing the Sequence Generator 1, if the next state equals the initial state for the second
          time, overwrite the state with an all-zero state. The next state following the state following all zero-
          state uses the first 6 bits of the state of Sequence Generator 2 as the initial state.
    —     If the STA’s total number of transmit sectors is not equal to the period of the Sequence Generator 1,
          ignore state(s) greater than or equal total number of transmit sectors and continue advancing
          Sequence Generator 1 until the state is less than the total number of transmit sectors.
 NOTE—The taps are selected from the set of sequences with maximal length property.

 The Direction field is set to 0 to indicate that the frame is transmitted by the beamforming initiator and set to
 1 to indicate that the frame is transmitted by the beamforming responder.
 The CDOWN field is a down-counter indicating the number of remaining DMG Beacon frame
 transmissions to the end of the TXSS, or the number of remaining SSW frame transmissions to the end of
 the TXSS/RXSS. This field is set to 0 in the last frame DMG Beacon and SSW frame transmission. Possible
 values range from 0 to 511.
 The Sector ID field is set to indicate the sector number through which the frame containing this SSW field is
 transmitted.
 The DMG Antenna ID field indicates the DMG antenna the transmitter is currently using for this
 transmission.
 The RXSS Length field is valid only when transmitted in a CBAP and is reserved otherwise. The RXSS
 Length field specifies the length of a receive sector sweep as required by the transmitting STA, and is
 defined in units of a SSW frame. The value of this field is in the range of 0 to 62, with odd values being
 reserved.
 NOTE—In a CBAP, a transmitting STA with multiple DMG antennas might not know the capabilities of the receiving
 STA; hence the size of the RXSS Length field is defined to cover for a single DMG antenna of the receiving STA.

 The TID field identifies the TC or TS for the allocation request or grant.
 NOTE—Unlike pseudo-static allocations, nonpseudo-static allocations are not labeled with an Allocation ID, and are
 associated to a TID.
 The AllocationType field is defined in 8.4.2.134.
 The Source AID field identifies the STA that is the source of the allocation.
 The Destination AID field identifies the STA that is the destination of the allocation.
 When the Dynamic Allocation Info field is transmitted within an SPR frame, the Allocation Duration field
 contains the requested duration in microseconds. When the Dynamic Allocation Info field is transmitted
 within a Grant frame, the Allocation Duration field contains the granted duration of the SP or CBAP
 allocation in microseconds (see 9.33.7, 9.33.8, and 9.33.9). Possible values range from 0 to 32 767 for an SP
 allocation and 0 to 65 535 for a CBAP allocation. A value of 0 in the Allocation Duration field transmitted
 within a Grant frame means that the STA can transmit one PPDU followed by any relevant acknowledgment
 plus one RTS/DMG CTS handshake.

The Total Sectors in ISS field indicates the total number of sectors that the initiator uses in the ISS,
including any repetition performed as part of multi-antenna beamforming. Possible values range from 0 to
511, representing 1 to 512 sectors.
The Number of RX DMG Antennas subfield indicates the number of receive DMG antennas the initiator
uses during the following RSS.
The Sector Select field contains the value of the Sector ID subfield of the SSW field within the frame that
was received with best quality in the immediately preceding sector sweep. The determination of which
packet was received with best quality is implementation dependent. Possible values of this field range from
0 to 63.
The DMG Antenna Select field indicates the value of the DMG Antenna ID subfield of the SSW field within
the frame that was received with best quality in the immediately preceding sector sweep. The determination
of which frame was received with best quality is implementation dependent.
The SNR Report field is set to the value of the SNR from the frame that was received with best
quality during the immediately preceding sector sweep, and which is indicated in the sector select field. This
field is encoded as 8-bit twos complement value of 4×(SNR-19), where SNR is measured in dB. This covers
from –13 dB to 50.75 dB in 0.25 dB steps.
The Poll Required field is set to 1 by a non-PCP/non-AP STA to indicate that it requires the PCP/AP to
initiate communication with the non-PCP/non-AP. This field is set to 0 to indicate that the non-PCP/non-AP
has no preference about whether the PCP/AP initiates the communication. This field is reserved when
transmitted by a PCP/AP.

 If the MID-REQ field is set to 0, the L-RX field indicates the compressed number of TRN-R subfields
 requested by the transmitting STA as part of beam refinement. To obtain the desired number of TRN-R
 subfields, the value of the L-RX field is multiplied by 4. Possible values range from 0 to 16, corresponding
 to 0 to 64 TRN-R fields. Other values are reserved. If the field is set to 0, the transmitting STA does not need
 receiver training as part of beam refinement. If the MID-REQ field is set to 1, the L-RX field indicates the
 compressed number of AWV settings that the STA uses during the MID phase. To obtain the number of
 AWVs that is used, the value of the L-RX field is multiplied by 4.
 The TX-TRN-REQ field is set to 1 to indicate that the STA needs transmit training as part of beam
 refinement. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 A STA sets the MID-REQ field to 1 in SSW-Feedback or BRP frames to indicate a request for an I/R-MID
 subphase; otherwise, the STA sets the field to 0 to indicate it is not requesting an I/R-MID subphase. In case
 an R-MID subphase is requested, the STA can include information on the TX sector IDs to be used by the
 STA receiving this request. The STA receiving this request sets the MID-grant field in SSW-ACK or BRP
 frames to 1 to grant this request or otherwise sets it to 0.
 A STA sets the BC-REQ field to 1 in SSW-Feedback or BRP frames to indicate a request for an I/R-BC
 subphase; otherwise, the STA sets the field to 0 to indicate it is not requesting an I/R-BC subphase. In case
 an R-BC subphase is requested, the STA can include information on the TX sector IDs to be used by the
 STA receiving this request. The STA receiving this request sets the BC-grant field in SSW-ACK or BRP
 frames to 1 to grant this request; otherwise, the STA sets it to 0 to reject the request.
 The Chan-FBCK-CAP field is set to 1 to indicate the STA is capable to return channel measurement during
 beam refinement. The Chan-FBCK-CAP field is set to 0 to indicate the STA is able to return only BS-FBCK
 during beam refinement.
 The TX sector ID field indicates the Sector ID that is used when transmitting the packet. If the packet is
 transmitted using a pattern that is not a sector that has been used in the sector sweep, the value of this field is
 set to 0x63.
 The Other_AID field is set to the AID of an additional STA referenced in the BRP procedure as described in
 9.35.6.4.4 and 21.10.2.2.6. Otherwise, if the additional STA is not used, this field is set to 0.
 The TX Antenna ID field indicates the DMG antenna ID that is used when transmitting the packet.
 8.4a.5 Beamforming Control field
 The Beamforming Control field is formatted as shown in Figure 8-431f when both the IsInitiatorTXSS and
 IsResponderTXSS subfields are equal to 1, and the Beamforming Control field is transmitted in either a
 Grant or Grant ACK frames. In all other cases, the Beamforming Control field is formatted as shown in
 Figure 8-431g.

The Beamforming Training subfield is set to 1 to indicate that the source DMG STA intends to initiate
beamforming training with the destination DMG STA at the start of the allocation and is set to 0 otherwise.
If the Beamforming Training subfield is set to 0, the IsInitiatorTXSS, IsResponderTXSS, and RXSS Length
subfields are reserved.
The IsInitiatorTXSS subfield is set to 1 to indicate that the source DMG STA starts the beamforming
training with an initiator TXSS. This subfield is set to 0 to indicate that the source DMG STA starts the BF
training with an initiator RXSS.
The IsResponderTXSS subfield is set to 1 to indicate that the destination DMG STA starts the RSS with a
responder TXSS. This subfield is set to 0 to indicate that the destination DMG STA is to initiate the RSS
with a responder RXSS.
The RXSS Length subfield is valid only if at least one of IsInitiatorTXSS subfield or IsResponderTXSS
subfield is equal to 0 and is reserved otherwise. The value represented by the RXSS Length subfield
specifies the total number of receive sectors combined over all receive DMG antennas of the STA. The
value represented by this subfield is in the range of 2 to 128 and is given by (RXSS Length+1)×2. The
maximum number of SSW frames transmitted during an RXSS is equal to the value of (RXSS Length+1)×2
times the total number of transmit DMG antennas of the peer device.
The RXSSTxRate subfield is valid only if the RXSS Length subfield is valid and the value of the RXSS
Length subfield is greater than 0. Otherwise, the RXSSTxRate subfield is reserved. The RXSSTxRate
subfield is set to 0 to indicate that all frames transmitted as part of the RXSS use the DMG Control
modulation class (9.7.5a.1). The RXSSTxRate subfield is set to 1 to indicate that only the first frame
transmitted as part of the RXSS use the DMG Control modulation class and the remaining frames use MCS
1 of the DMG SC modulation class. If both IsInitiatorTXSS and IsResponderTXSS are set to 0 and the BF
Control field is sent within a Grant frame, the RXSSTxRate subfield refers to the RSS only. If both
IsInitiatorTXSS and IsResponderTXSS are set to 0 and the BF Control field is sent within a Grant ACK
frame, the RXSSTxRate subfield refers to the ISS only.
When the BF Control field is transmitted in a Grant frame, the Total Number of Sectors subfield indicates
the total number of sectors the initiator uses during the ISS. When the BF Control field is transmitted in a
Grant ACK frame, the Total Number of Sectors subfield indicates the total number of sectors the responder
uses during the RSS.

 If the content of the BeamLink Maintenance value field is greater than 0, it is used to calculate the value of
 dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime as follows:
    dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime = BLMU × BLMV
 where
    BLMU         is the value of the BeamLink Maintenance Unit corresponding to the value of the BeamLink
                 Maintenance Unit Index field (see Table 8-190a)
    BLMV         is the value of the BeamLink Maintenance Value field
 Otherwise, if the value of the BeamLink Maintenance value field is 0, the dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime
 is left undefined. An undefined value of the dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime indicates that the STA does
 not participate in beamformed link maintenance.
 The BeamLink isMaster field is set to 1 to indicate that the DMG STA is the master of the data transfer and
 set to 0 if the DMG STA is a slave of the data transfer. The DMG STAs use the BeamLink isMaster field to
 negotiate the dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime as specified in Table 8-190b.
 NOTE—In Table 8-190b, DMG STA-A and DMG STA-B refer to any of the STAs performing the Beamformed Link
 Maintenance negotiation procedure in no particular order.

The Dialog Token, DMG TSPEC, TSPEC, TCLAS, and TCLAS Processing fields of this frame are
contained in an MLME-ADDTS.request primitive that causes the frame to be sent.
The DMG TSPEC element contains the parameters that define an allocation. The allocation uniquely
identified by the source DMG STA MAC Address, Allocation ID, and destination AID within the DMG
TSPEC element.
The optional TSPEC element defines a TS that can use the allocation should the allocation be created
successfully.
The TCLAS element is optional and can be present only when a TSPEC element is present; it is used to
identify the destination non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA of the ADDTS Request frame. There can be one or
more TCLAS elements in the DMG ADDTS Request frame. The TCLAS Processing element is present if
there is more than one TCLAS element.
When present in a DMG ADDTS Request frame, the Multi-band element indicates the frequency band,
operating class, and channel number to which the TS identified by the optional TSPEC element applies.
When present in the DMG ADDTS Request frame, the Upper Layer Protocol Identification (U-PID)
element indicates the upper layer protocol associated with the TS identified by the optional TSPEC element
contained in this frame.

 8.5.22.2 Announce frame format
 The Announce frame is an Action or an Action No Ack frame of category Unprotected DMG. The format of
 an Announce frame Action field is shown in Table 8-281af.
 Announce frames can be transmitted during the ATI of a beacon interval and can perform functions
 including of a DMG Beacon frame, but since this frame does not have to be transmitted as a sector sweep to
 a STA, it can provide much more spectrally efficient access than using a DMG Beacon frame.

The Channel Measurement Feedback element is defined in 8.4.2.138.
The BRP frame contains more than one Channel Measurement Feedback element if the measurement
information exceeds 255 bytes. The content of each Channel Measurement Feedback element that follows
the first one in a single BRP frame is a continuation of the content in the previous element. The Channel
Measurement, Tap Delay, and Sector ID Order subfields can be split between several elements. Each
Channel Measurement Feedback element that is not the last Channel Measurement Feedback element in the
frame is 257 bytes long. Channel measurement information for a single channel measurement is always
contained within a single BRP frame.
NOTE—The length of a BRP frame can limit the choice of channel measurement parameters such as the number of
measurements and the number of taps.

 8.6.1 A-MPDU format
 Change the second, third, and fourth paragraphs in 8.6.1 as follows:
 The structure of the A-MPDU subframe is shown in Figure 8-504. Each A-MPDU subframe consists of an
 MPDU delimiter followed by an MPDU. Except when an A-MPDU subframe is the last one in an A-MPDU,
 padding octets are appended to make each A-MPDU subframe a multiple of 4 octets in length. The A-
 MPDU maximum length for a non-DMG STA is 65 535 octets. The A-MPDU maximum length for a DMG
 STA is 262 143 octets. The length of an A-MPDU addressed to a particular STA may be further constrained
 as described in 9.12.2.
 Figure 8-504 remains unchanged.
 The MPDU delimiter is 4 octets in length. The structure of the MPDU delimiter when transmitted by a non-
 DMG STA is defined in Figure 8-505. The structure of the MPDU Delimiter field when transmitted by a
 DMG STA is shown in Figure 8-505a.

9.2 MAC architecture
9.2.1 General
Change 9.2.1 (including Figure 9-1) as follows:
A representation of tThe MAC architecture is shown in Figure 9-1. in which the PCF and HCF services are
provided using When operating with any of the Clause 14 through Clause 20 PHYs, the MAC provides the
HCF, including the PCF, through the services of the DCF. Note that in a non-Qos STA, HCF is not present.
In a non-DMG QoS STA implementation, both DCF and HCF are present. In a non-DMG non-QoS STA
implementation, only DCF is present. PCF is optional in all non-DMG STAs.
Due to the distributed nature of the MBSS, only the MCF is present in a mesh STA.
When operating with a DMG PHY (Clause 21), the MAC provides services using the DMG channel access
mechanisms. Specific rules apply for access during scheduled periods, which include the association
beamforming training (A-BFT) period, announcement transmission interval (ATI), contention-based access
period (CBAP), and service period (SP). The DCF is used during contention-based access periods. Dynamic
allocation (9.33.7) is built on service period and contention-based access period.

 9.2.2 DCF
 Change 9.2.2 as follows:
 The fundamental access method of the IEEE 802.11 MAC used by non-DMG STAs is a DCF known as
 carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The DCF shall be implemented in all
 STAs.
 For a STA to transmit, it shall sense the medium to determine if another STA is transmitting. If the medium
 is not determined to be busy (see 9.3.2.1), the transmission may proceed. The CSMA/CA distributed
 algorithm mandates that a gap of a minimum specified duration exist between contiguous frame sequences.
 A transmitting STA shall ensure that the medium is idle for this required duration before attempting to
 transmit. If the medium is determined to be busy, the non-DMG STA shall defer until the end of the current
 transmission, and a DMG STA may defer until the end of the current transmission. After deferral, or prior to
 attempting to transmit again immediately after a successful transmission, the STA shall select a random
 backoff interval and shall decrement the backoff interval counter while the medium is idle. A transmission is
 successful either when an ACK frame is received from the STA addressed by the RA field of the transmitted
 frame or when a frame with a group address in the RA field is transmitted completely. A refinement of the
 method may be used under various circumstances to further minimize collisions—here the transmitting and
 receiving STAs exchange short control frames (RTS and CTS frames for non-DMG STAs and RTS and
 DMG CTS frames for DMG STAs) after determining that the medium is idle and after any deferrals or
 backoffs, prior to data transmission. The details of CSMA/CA, deferrals, and backoffs are described in 9.3.
 RTS/CTS and RTS/DMG CTS exchanges are also presented in 9.3.
 9.2.4 Hybrid coordination function (HCF)
 9.2.4.2 HCF contention-based channel access (EDCA)
 Insert the following note after Table 9-1 (UP-to-AC mappings):
 NOTE—A DMG STA that implements a single AC (see 9.19.2.1) has all of its UP values in Table 9-1 mapped to
 AC_BE.
 Change the sixth paragraph of 9.2.4.2 as indicated below:
 The AP and PCP may use a different set of EDCA parameters from what it advertises to the STAs in its
 BSS.
 9.2.7 Fragmentation/defragmentation overview
 Insert the following paragraphs at the end of 9.2.7:
 A QoS Data MPDU with a TID matching an existing BA agreement may be transmitted outside an A-
 MPDU with its Ack Policy subfield set to Normal Ack.
 Transmission of fragmented MPDUs by a DMG STA outside of an A-MPDU depends on setting of the No-
 Fragmentation field in the ADDBA Extension element within the ADDBA Response frame transmitted
 during the BA agreement handshake. The MSDU shall not be fragmented if the No-Fragmentation field in
 the ADDBA Extension element within the ADDBA Response frame transmitted during the BA agreement
 handshake is 1. If the No-Fragmentation field in the ADDBA Extension element within the ADDBA
 Response frame is 0, the originator may send fragmented nonaggregated MSDU with Normal ACK policy
 under BA agreement.

9.3 DCF
9.3.1 General
Insert the following paragraphs after the second paragraph (“The CSMA/CA protocol is ....”) of 9.3.1:
The DCF is modified for use by DMG STAs to allow sharing of the medium between compatible DMG
PHYs (see 9.3.4). A DMG STA has no direct knowledge of when it might interfere (collide with the
transmission of) another STA.
The CS function of a DMG STA might not indicate the medium busy condition due to the predominant
nature of directional transmissions and receptions. The transmission of a STA might interfere (collide) with
the transmission of another STA even though the CS function at the first STA does not indicate medium
busy. The interference (collision) is identified when the expected response frame is not received. SPSH is
achieved by the proper combination of the STA antenna configuration during the media access and data
transfer phases.
Change the now twelfth paragraph in 9.3.1 as follows:
All STAs that are members of a BSS are able to receive and transmit at all the data rates in the
BSSBasicRateSet parameter of the MLME-START.request primitive or BSSBasicRateSet parameter of the
BSSDescription representing the SelectedBSS parameter of the MLME-JOIN.request primitive; see
6.3.4.2.4 and 6.3.11.2.4. All HT STAs and DMG STAs that are members of a BSS are able to receive and
transmit using all the MCSs in the BSSBasicMCSSet parameter of the MLME-START.request primitive or
BSSBasicMCSSet parameter of the BSSDescription representing the SelectedBSS parameter of the MLME-
JOIN.request primitive; see 6.3.4.2.4 and 6.3.11.2.4. To support the proper operation of the RTS/CTS by
non-DMG STAs, RTS/DMG CTS by DMG STAs, and the virtual CS mechanism, all non-DMG STAs shall
be able to interpret control frames with the Subtype field set to RTS or CTS, and all DMG STAs shall be
able to interpret control frames with the Subtype field set to RTS or DMG CTS.
Insert the following paragraph at the end of 9.3.1:
While in the WAKE state and operating under DCF but not transmitting, a DMG STA can configure its
receive antenna to a quasi-omni pattern in order to receive frames transmitted by any STA that is covered by
this antenna pattern.
9.3.2 Procedures common to the DCF and EDCAF
9.3.2.1 CS mechanism
Change the third and fourth paragraphs of 9.3.2.1 as follows:
A virtual CS mechanism shall be provided by the MAC. This mechanism is referred to as the NAV. The
NAV maintains a prediction of future traffic on the medium based on duration information that is announced
in RTS/CTS frames by non-DMG STAs and RTS/DMG CTS frames by DMG STAs prior to the actual
exchange of data. The duration information is also available in the MAC headers of all frames sent during
the CP, other than PS-Poll frames, and during the BTI, the A-BFT, the ATI, the CBAP, and the SP. The
mechanism for setting the NAV using RTS/CTS or RTS/DMG CTS in the DCF is described in 9.3.2.4, use
of the NAV in PCF is described in 9.4.3.3, and the use of the NAV in HCF is described in 9.19.2.2 and
9.19.3.4. Additional details regarding NAV usage and update appear in 9.3.2.5, 9.3.2.11, 9.33.10, and 9.23.
The CS mechanism combines the NAV state and the STA’s transmitter status with physical CS to determine
the busy/idle state of the medium. The NAV may be thought of as a counter, which counts down to 0 at a
uniform rate. When the counter is 0, the virtual CS indication is that the medium is idle; when the counter is

 nonzero, the indication is busy. If a DMG STA supports multiple NAV timers as defined in 9.33.10 and all
 counters are 0, the virtual CS indication is that the medium is idle; when at least one of the counters is
 nonzero, the indication is busy. The medium shall be determined to be busy when the STA is transmitting.
 9.3.2.3 IFS
 9.3.2.3.1 General
 Change the first paragraph of 9.3.2.3.1 as follows:
 The time interval between frames is called the IFS. A STA shall determine that the medium is idle through
 the use of the CS function for the interval specified. SixEight different IFSs are defined to provide priority
 levels for access to the wireless media. Figure 9-3 shows some of these relationships. All timings are
 referenced from the PHY interface signals PHY-TXEND.confirm, PHY-TXSTART.confirm, PHY-
 RXSTART.indication, and PHY-RXEND.indication primitives.
 Insert the following list items into the lettered list of the first paragraph of 9.3.2.3.1:
    g)    SBIFS Short Beamforming Interframe Spacing
    h)    BRPIFS Beam Refinement Protocol Interframe Spacing
    i)    MBIFS Medium Beamforming Interframe Spacing
    j)    LBIFS Long Beamforming Interframe Spacing
 9.3.2.3.2 RIFS
 Change the second paragraph (including adding the dashed list and creating a new third paragraph) of
 9.3.2.3.2 as follows:
 RIFS may be used in place of SIFS to separate multiple transmissions from a single transmitter when no
 SIFS-separated response transmission is expected. and at least one of the following is true:
    —     The transmitter is not a DMG STA.
    —     The transmitter is a DMG STA, and each transmission occurs with the same transmit antenna
          configuration.
 RIFS shall not be used between frames with different RA values. The duration of RIFS is defined by the
 aRIFS PHY characteristic (see Table 20-25 and Table 21-31). The RIFS is the time from the end of the last
 symbol of the previous frame to the beginning of the first symbol of the preamble of the subsequent frame as
 seen at the air interface. A STA shall not allow the space between frames that are defined to be separated by
 a RIFS time, as measured on the medium, to vary from the nominal RIFS value (aRIFSTime) by more than
 ± 10% of aRIFSTime. Two frames separated by a RIFS shall both be HT PPDUs or shall both be DMG
 PPDUs.
 9.3.2.3.3 SIFS
 Change 9.3.2.3.3 as follows:
 The SIFS shall be used prior to transmission of an ACK frame, a CTS frame, a PPDU containing a
 BlockAck frame that is an immediate response to either a BlockAckReq frame or an A-MPDU, a DMG CTS
 frame, a DMG DTS frame, an SSW-ACK frame, a Grant ACK frame, a response frame transmitted in the
 ATI, and the second or subsequent MPDU of a fragment burst and by a STA responding to any polling by
 the PCF. The SIFS may also be used by a PC for any type of frame during the CFP (see 9.4). The SIFS is the
 224                                                                       Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

time from the end of the last symbol, or signal extension if present, of the previous frame to the beginning of
the first symbol of the preamble of the subsequent frame as seen at the air interface.
The SIFS timing shall be achieved when the transmission of the subsequent frame is started at the TxSIFS
Slot boundary as specified in 9.3.7. An IEEE 802.11 implementation of a non-DMG STA shall not allow the
space between frames that are defined to be separated by a SIFS time, as measured on the medium, to vary
from the nominal SIFS value by more than ± 10% of aSlotTime for the PHY in use. An implementation of a
DMG STA shall not allow the space between frames that are defined to be separated by a SIFS time, as
measured on the medium, to vary from the nominal SIFS value by more than –0% or +10% of aSlotTime.
SIFS is the shortest of the IFSs between transmissions from different STAs. SIFS shall be used when STAs
have seized the medium and need to keep it for the duration of the frame exchange sequence to be
performed. Using the smallest gap between transmissions within the frame exchange sequence prevents
other STAs, which are required to wait for the medium to be idle for a longer gap, from attempting to use the
medium, thus giving priority to completion of the frame exchange sequence in progress.
When transmitting a response frame immediately following a SIFS period, a DMG STA shall set the
TXVECTOR parameter LAST_RSSI of the response frame to the power that was measured on the received
packet, as reported in the RCPI field of the frame that elicited the response frame. The encoding of the value
is as follows:
   —     Power values less than or equal to –68 dBm are represented as the value of 1.
   —     Power values between –68 dBm and –42 dBm are represented as round((power – (–71 dBm))/2).
   —     Power values equal to or above –42 dBm are represented as the value 15.
   —     For all other cases, the DMG STA shall set the TXVECTOR parameter LAST_RSSI of the
         transmitted frame to 0.
A DMG STA that transmits a PPDU containing at least one individually addressed MPDU shall set the
TXVECTOR parameter Turnaround to 1 if the DMG STA is required to listen for an incoming PPDU
immediately following the transmission of the PPDU; otherwise, the DMG STA shall set the TXVECTOR
parameter Turnaround to 0. The DMG STA shall set the TXVECTOR parameter Turnaround to 0 when it
transmits an RTS frame.
9.3.2.3.4 PIFS
Insert the following items at the end of the dashed list after the second paragraph of 9.3.2.3.4:
   —     A PCP/AP continuing to transmit in the ATI after a transmission failure during the ATI (9.33.3)
   —     A source DMG STA of an SP continuing to transmit after a transmission failure as described in
         9.33.6.2
   —     A DMG STA performing EDCA access during an allocated CBAP as described in 9.33.5
9.3.2.3.6 AIFS
Change 9.3.2.3.6 as follows:
The AIFS shall be used by QoS STAs that access the medium using the EDCAF to transmit all data frames
(MPDUs) except during the ATI or an SP, all management frames (MMPDUs) except during the ATI or an
SP, all extension frames except for the DMG Beacon frame, and the following control frames:
   —     PS-Poll,
   —     SSW (if first transmission by initiator in a CBAP)
   —     Poll (if first transmission and when in a CBAP)

    —    CTS (when not transmitted as a response to the RTS),
    —    DMG CTS (when not transmitted as a response to the RTS)
    —    BlockAckReq, and
    —    BlockAck (when not transmitted as a response to the BlockAckReq).
 A STA using the EDCAF shall obtain a TXOP for an AC if the STA’s CS mechanism (see 9.3.2.1)
 determines that the medium is idle at the AIFS[AC] slot boundary (see 9.19.2.3), after a correctly received
 frame, and the backoff time for that AC has expired.
 A non-PCP/non-AP QoS STA computes the time periods for each AIFS[AC] from the
 dot11EDCATableAIFSN attributes in the MIB. In an infrastructure BSS, QoS STAs update their
 dot11EDCATableAIFSN values using information in the most recent EDCA Parameter Set element of
 Beacon frames received from the AP of the BSS (see 8.4.2.31) if the STA is a non-DMG STA or the most
 recent EDCA Parameter Set element of DMG Beacon and Announce frames received from the PCP/AP of
 the BSS if the STA is a DMG STA. A QoS PCP/AP computes the time periods for each AIFS[AC] from the
 dot11QAPEDCATableAIFSN attributes in its MIB.
 Insert the following subclauses, 9.3.2.3.8 to 9.3.2.3.11, after 9.3.2.3.7:
 9.3.2.3.8 SBIFS
 SBIFS shall be used to separate multiple transmissions from a single transmitter during a receive sector
 sweep or when each transmission occurs with a different transmit antenna configuration and no SIFS-
 separated response transmission is expected. The duration of SBIFS is determined by the aSBIFS PHY
 characteristic. The SBIFS is the time from the end of the last symbol of the previous frame to the beginning
 of the first symbol of the preamble of the subsequent frame as seen at the air interface. A STA shall not
 allow the space between frames that are defined to be separated by a SBIFS time, as measured on the
 medium, to vary from the nominal SBIFS value (aSBIFSTime) by more than aSBIFSAccuracy. Two frames
 separated by a SBIFS shall both be DMG PPDUs.
 9.3.2.3.9 BRPIFS
 BRPIFS shall be used by STAs between any combination of transmissions of BRP-TX and BRP-RX
 packets. The BRPIFS is the maximum time from the end of the last symbol of the previous PPDU, or
 training field if present in the PPDU, to the beginning of the first symbol of the preamble of the subsequent
 PPDU as seen at the air interface. The corresponding minimum time is SIFS. BRPIFS is defined to be equal
 to aBRPIFS+10%.
 9.3.2.3.10 MBIFS
 MBIFS shall be used between the BTI and the A-BFT and between the ISS, RSS, SSW Feedback, and SSW
 ACK. MBIFS is equal to 3×aSIFStime. An implementation of a DMG STA shall not allow the space
 between frames that are separated by MBIFS time, as measured on the medium, to vary from the nominal
 MBIFS value by more than –0% or +10 of aSlotTime.
 9.3.2.3.11 LBIFS
 LBIFS shall be used between transmissions employing different DMG antennas and when the recipient STA
 is expected to switch DMG antennas. LBIFS is equal to 6×aSIFStime. An implementation of a DMG STA

shall not allow the space between frames that are separated by LBIFS time, as measured on the medium, to
vary from the nominal LBIFS value by more than –0% or +10 of aSlotTime.
9.3.2.4 Setting and resetting the NAV
Insert the following paragraph as the new first paragraph of 9.3.2.4:
This subclause describes the setting and resetting of the NAV timer for non-DMG STAs and DMG STAs
that support a single NAV timer. DMG STAs that support multiple NAV timers shall update their NAV
timers according to the procedures described in 9.33.10.
Change the title of 9.3.2.6 as follows:
9.3.2.6 CTS and DMG CTS procedure
Insert the following paragraph at the end of 9.3.2.6:
A DMG STA follows the procedure defined in this subclause, except that it uses a DMG CTS frame instead
of a CTS frame. A non-DMG STA does not transmit DMG CTS frames.
9.3.2.10 Duplicate detection and recovery
Change the second paragraph of 9.3.2.10 as follows:
Duplicate frame filtering is facilitated through the inclusion of a Sequence Control field (consisting of a
sequence number and fragment number) within data, extension, and management frames, a TID subfield in
the QoS Control field within QoS data frames, and an ACI subfield in the Sequence Number field within
QMFs. MPDUs that are part of the same MSDU or A-MSDU shall have the same sequence number, and
different MSDUs or A-MSDUs have (with a high probability) a different sequence number.
Change the fourth paragraph of 9.3.2.10 as follows:
A STA operating as a QoS STA shall maintain one modulo-4096 counter, per <Address 1, TID> tuple, for
individually addressed QoS Data frames. Sequence numbers for these frames are assigned using the counter
identified by the Address 1 field and the TID subfield of the QoS Control field of the frame, and that counter
is incremented by 1 for each MSDU or A-MSDU corresponding to that <Address 1, TID> tuple. Sequence
numbers for management frames, extension frames (when this field is present), QoS data frames with a
group address in the Address 1 field, and all non-QoS data frames transmitted by QoS STAs with
dot11QMFActivated false or not present shall be assigned using an additional single modulo-4096 counter,
starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each such MSDU, A-MSDU, or MMPDU, except that a QoS STA
may use values from additional modulo-4096 counters per <Address 1, TID> for sequence numbers
assigned to time priority management frames. A transmitting STA should cache the last used sequence
number per RA for frames that are assigned sequence numbers from this counter and should ensure that the
successively assigned sequence numbers for frames transmitted to a single RA do not have the same value
by incrementing the counter by 2, if incrementing by 1 would have produced the same sequence number as
is found in the cache for that RA.

 9.3.2.11 NAV distribution
 Change the first paragraph of 9.3.2.11 as follows:
 When a node needs to distribute NAV information, for instance, to reserve the medium for a transmission of
 a nonbasic rate frame (that may not be heard by other nodes in the BSS), the node may first transmit a CTS
 frame with the RA field equal to its own MAC address (CTS-to-self) if the node is a non-DMG STA, or it
 may transmit a DMG CTS with the RA field equal to its own MAC address and the TA field equal to the
 MAC address of the peer DMG STA for which the forthcoming transmission of the node is intended (DMG
 CTS-to-self) if the node is a DMG STA. Aand with a duration value in the framethat protects the pending
 transmission, plus possibly an ACK frame.
 Insert the following paragraph at the end of 9.3.2.11:
 A DMG STA shall not transmit a DMG DTS frame outside an SP.
 9.3.3 Random backoff time
 Change the last sentence in the first paragraph of 9.3.3 as follows:
 This process minimizes collisions during contention between multiple STAS that have been deferring to the
 same event in a non-DMG network.
 9.3.4 DCF access procedure
 9.3.4.2 Basic access
 Insert the following paragraphs and note after the second paragraph (“In general, a STA may ....) of
 9.3.4.2:
 A DMG STA operating under the DCF access method should transmit frames with its transmit antenna
 pattern directed towards the intended receiver.
 A DMG STA operating under the DCF access method that does not operate in a TXOP exchange may
 configure its receiving antenna array to a quasi-omni antenna pattern to be ready to receive frames from any
 DMG STA.
 NOTE—The steady state of the antenna configuration might depend on the actual applications in which the DMG STA
 is involved. For example, a DMG STA that expects transactions with several DMG STAs during a CBAP configures the
 receiving antenna to a quasi-omni pattern to be ready to receive transmission from any of the DMG STA. A DMG STA
 that expects transactions with a single DMG STA (e.g., PCP/AP) might keep its receiving antenna directed to the peer
 DMG STA.
 A DMG STA operating under the DCF access method that is participating in a TXOP exchange should
 configure its receiving antenna array to be directed toward the other transmitter involved in the TXOP.

To begin the backoff procedure, the STA shall set its Backoff Timer to a random backoff time using the
equation in 9.3.3. All backoff slots occur following a DIFS period during which the medium is determined
to be idle for the duration of the DIFS period or following an EIFS period during which the medium is
determined to be idle for the duration of the EIFS period, as appropriate (see 9.3.2.3), except that no backoff
slots for DCF occur during the BTI, the A-BFT, the ATI, and non-CBAP portions of the DTI.

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                              LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 Change the seventh paragraph of 9.3.4.3 as follows:
 The effect of this procedure is that when multiple STAs are deferring and go into random backoff, then the
 STA selecting the smallest backoff time using the random function wins the contention (assuming all of the
 contending STAs detect the same instances of WM activity at their respective receivers, a situation that is
 not always true, due to hidden node effects and interference events). The number of DMG STAs that are
 able to detect each WM transmission is reduced even further due to SPSH.
 Insert the following text at the end of 9.3.4.3:
 Figure 9-12b describes the backoff procedure for DMG STAs for the example topology shown in Figure 9-
 12a.
 At the time that STA A starts transmitting a frame to STA E and STA E starts receiving the frame, the
 antennas of both stations are directed to the peer, i.e., the transmitting antennas of STA A are directed to
 STA E and the receiving antennas of STA E are directed to STA A. At this point, STA B, STA C, and STA
 D are not involved in any frame exchange; therefore, they are in receiving state and happen to have the
 configuration of their receiving antenna arrays set to a quasi-omni antenna pattern to be ready to receive
 frames from any STA.
 STA B receives the frame transmitted by STA A (to STA E), and CS (physical and virtual) in STA B
 indicates a busy medium during the exchange between STA A and STA E.
 STA D is not able to receive the frame transmitted by STA A or the response transmitted by STA E; hence
 CS in STA D indicates IDLE for the duration of the exchange between STA A and STA E.
 The physical CS function of STA C indicates a medium busy condition when it receives the response sent by
 STA E, but indicates an idle medium condition during the transmission from STA A.
 STA A and STA E (which are directly involved in the frame exchange), STA B (which received the frame
 sent by STA A), and STA C (which received the response sent by STA E) are synchronized at point A,
 where the transaction between STA A and STA E completes.
 Since STA D cannot hear the directional transmissions from either STA A or STA C, its physical CS
 indicates an idle medium condition for the duration of the frame exchange, enabling a frame exchange with
 STA B at the same time as the frame exchange between STA A and STA E. This is an example of SPSH.
 Because STA C is unaware of the transmission of the frame from STA A to STA E, STA C transmits an
 RTS to STA B. But STA C does not receive a DMG CTS from STA B since the CS at STA B is busy when
 STA B receives the RTS from the STA C. This causes STA C to retry the RTS transmission following the
 expiration of a backoff count, which occurs after the completion of the exchange between STA A and
 STA E.
 9.3.4.4 Recovery procedures and retransmit limits
 Change the fifth paragraph of 9.3.4.4 as follows:
 Retries for failed transmission attempts shall continue until the SRC for the MPDU of type Data or MMPDU
 is equal to dot11ShortRetryLimit or until the LRC for the MPDU of type Data or MMPDU is equal to
 dot11LongRetryLimit. When either of these limits is reached, retry attempts shall cease, and the MPDU of
 type Data (and any MSDU of which it is a part) or MMPDU shall be discarded. A DMG STA, in addition to
 using random access within a CBAP, may transmit retries in available scheduled SPs.

9.3.6 Group addressed MPDU transfer procedure
Change the first paragraph of 9.3.6 as follows:
In the absence of a PCF or use of the group addressed transmission service (GATS), when group addressed
MPDUs in which the To DS field is 0 are transferred from a STA, only the basic access procedure shall be
used. When group addressed MPDUs are not delivered using GATS, no RTS/CTS or RTS/DMG CTS
exchange shall be used, regardless of the length of the frame. In addition, no ACK shall be transmitted by
any of the recipients of the frame. Any group addressed MPDUs in which the To DS field is 1 transferred
from a STA shall, in addition to conforming to the basic access procedure of CSMA/CA, obey the rules for
RTS/CTS exchange and the ACK procedure because the MPDU is directed to the AP. For DMG STAs, the
MPDU transmission shall also conform to the access procedures defined in 9.33. When
dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated is true, an AP shall distribute the group addressed message into the BSS only
if dot11NonAPStationAuthSourceMulticast in the dot11InterworkingEntry identified by the source MAC
address in the received message is true. When dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated is false, the group addressed
message shall be distributed into the BSS. Unless the MPDU is delivered via DMS, the STA originating the
message receives the message as a group addressed message (prior to any filtering). Therefore, all STAs
shall filter out group addressed messages that contain their address as the source address. When
dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated is false, group addressed MSDUs shall be propagated throughout the ESS.
When dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated is true, group addressed MSDUs shall be propagated throughout the
ESS only if dot11NonAPStationAuthSourceMulticast in the dot11InterworkingEntry identified by the
source MAC address in the received message is true.
Insert the following paragraph after the third paragraph (“As a result, the reliability ....”) of 9.3.6:
A DMG STA may transmit a copy of the same group addressed MPDU using different antenna
configurations. This might be needed to provide a quasi-omni coverage or to enable transmission by an
MCS that is higher than MCS 0. If multiple copies of a group addressed MPDU with a To DS field equal to
0 are transferred, the DMG STA shall not transmit a different frame before the completion of the
transmission of all copies of the group addressed MPDU.
9.5 Fragmentation
Insert the following paragraph at the end of 9.5:
Except when using Block Ack, a STA that supports the DMG PHY shall complete the transmission of a
fragmented MSDU before starting transmission of another MSDU with the same TID of the fragmented
MSDU.

Change the fourth paragraph of 9.7.1 as follows:
Otherwise, a non-DMG STA the frame shall be transmitted the frame using a rate that is in accordance with
rules defined in 9.7.5 and 9.7.6. A DMG STA shall transmit the frame using a rate that is in accordance with
rules defined in 9.7.5a.
Change the last paragraph of 9.7.1 as follows:
For the Clause 18, Clause 17, Clause 19, Clause 21, and Clause 20 PHYs, the time required to transmit a
frame for use in calculating the value for the Duration/ID field is determined using the

 QoS STAs, the Duration/ID field may cover multiple frames and may involve using the PLME-
 TXTIME.request primitive several times.
 Insert the following subclauses, 9.7.5a to 9.7.5a.5, after 9.7.5.6:
 9.7.5a Multirate support for DMG STAs
 9.7.5a.1 Usage of DMG Control modulation class
 The DMG Control modulation class has only one MCS, which is DMG MCS 0 defined in Clause 21. The
 DMG Beacon, SSW-Feedback, SSW-ACK, RTS, DMG CTS, DMG CTS-To-Self, DMG DTS, and first
 BRP packet in beam refinement shall be transmitted using the DMG Control modulation class. In the case of
 an RXSS that was specified through the Beamforming Control field with the value of the RXSSTxRate
 subfield equal to 1 and the RXSSTxRate Supported field in the DMG Capabilities element of the STA
 performing the RXSS is 1, the first SSW frame of the RXSS shall be transmitted using the DMG Control
 modulation class, and the remaining frames of the RXSS shall be transmitted using MCS 1 of the DMG SC
 modulation class. In all other cases, the SSW frames shall be transmitted using the DMG Control
 modulation class. Other DMG beamforming training frames may be transmitted using the DMG Control
 modulation class or the DMG SC modulation class.
 9.7.5a.2 Rate selection rules for control frames transmitted by DMG STAs
 This subclause describes the rate selection rules for control frames transmitted by DMG STAs. The rate
 selection rules apply only for MCSs defined in Clause 21.
 A control frame that does not have an MCS defined in 9.7.5a.1 and that is not a control response frame shall
 be transmitted using an MCS from the mandatory MCS set of the DMG SC modulation class or DMG
 Control modulation class.
 A STA transmitting an ACK or a BA frame that is a response to a frame sent using the DMG low-power SC
 modulation class shall use the same modulation class and an MCS chosen from the DMG low-power SC
 Supported MCS set of the STA that transmitted the frame that elicited the response. The MCS index shall be
 the same as or lower than the MCS of the frame that elicited the response.
 A STA transmitting a Grant ACK frame shall use the DMG Control modulation class or any MCS from the
 mandatory MCS set of the DMG SC modulation class.
 A STA transmitting an ACK or a BA frame that is a response to a frame sent using the DMG Control
 modulation class shall use the DMG Control modulation class.
 A STA transmitting an ACK frame or a BA frame in response to a frame sent using the DMG SC
 modulation class or DMG OFDM modulation class shall use an MCS from the mandatory MCS set of the
 DMG SC modulation class and shall use the highest MCS index for which the Data Rate is the same as or
 lower than that of the frame that elicited the response.
 NOTE—A control response frame is a control frame that is transmitted within an MPDU as a response to a reception
 SIFS time after the PPDU containing the frame that elicits the response, e.g., a DMG CTS in response to an RTS
 reception, an ACK in response to a DATA reception, a BA in response to a BAR reception. In some situations, the
 transmission of some of these control frames is not a control response transmission, such as when a DMG CTS is used to
 initiate a TXOP.

The rules in this subclause do not apply to control frames that are contained in A-MPDUs that also include at
least one MPDU of type Data or Management. Exception is an A-MPDU consisting of one of the following
combinations:
   —     An ACK frame and a QoS Null frame
   —     A BA frame and a QoS Null frame
   —     A BAR frame and a QoS Null frame
   —     A BA frame, a BAR frame, and a QoS Null frame
In these exceptions, the rate selection rules are the same as those for a standalone ACK or BA frame.
9.7.5a.3 Rate selection for group addressed data and management frames transmitted by
DMG STAs
This subclause describes the rate selection rules for group addressed data and management frames
transmitted by DMG STAs. The rate selection rules apply only for MCSs defined in Clause 21.
If the transmit antenna pattern of a single transmission of a group addressed frame covers more than one
receiver and the supported MCS set of each of the receivers is known to the sender, then the MCS used for
the transmission shall be an MCS common to the supported MCS sets of all the receivers. If such an MCS is
not known, the frame shall be transmitted using an MCS from the mandatory MCS set of the DMG Control
or SC PHY.
If the transmit antenna pattern of a single transmission of a group addressed frame covers only one receiver,
the frame shall be transmitted following the rate selection rules of individually addressed frames as
described in 9.7.5a.4.
9.7.5a.4 Rate selection for individually addressed data and management frames transmitted
by DMG STAs
This subclause describes the rate selection rules for individually addressed data and management frames as
transmitted by DMG STAs. The rate selection rules apply only for MCSs defined in Clause 21.
An individually addressed data or management frame shall be sent using any MCS subject to the following
constraints:
   —     A STA shall not transmit a frame using an MCS that is not supported by the receiver STA, as
         reported in the maximum receive MCS subfields in the Supported MCS Set field in management
         frames transmitted by the receiver STA.
   —     A STA shall not initiate transmission of a frame at an MCS index higher than the highest
         Transmission MCS in the OperationalRateSet, which is a parameter of the MLME-JOIN.request
         primitive.
When the Supported MCS set of the receiving STA is not known, the transmitting STA shall transmit using
an MCS from the mandatory MCS set of the DMG Control or SC PHY.
The rules in this subclause also apply to A-MPDUs that contain at least one control type of MPDU and at
least one MPDU of type Data or Management.
9.7.5a.5 Rate selection for BRP packets
The first BRP packet transmitted from the initiator to the responder after the SLS phase shall use MCS 0.
The first BRP packet transmitted from the responder to the initiator after the SLS phase shall use MCS 0.

 BRP packets transmitted during beam refinement should use MCS 1 and shall not use any MCS greater than
 MCS 12. BRP packets transmitted during beam refinement should use MCS 0 if the BRP packet is sent at
 start of an SP as defined in 9.33.6.2.
 BRP packets transmitted during the BRP setup subphase, the MID subphase, and the BC subphase shall use
 MCS 0.
 BRP packets transmitted during a BC subphase, as part of a BC subphase only training, may use MCS 0-
 MCS 12.
 BRP packets transmitted during beam tracking may use any MCS.

 9.11 A-MSDU operation
 Insert the following paragraphs at the start of 9.11:
 The transmitter of frames for a TID established using a PTP TSPEC shall use an A-MSDU subframe format
 that is the result of the PTP TSPEC negotiation for that TID. The A-MSDU subframe format is negotiated
 using the PTP TSPEC (8.4.2.32): the Short A-MSDU subframe format shall not be used for frames of the
 corresponding TID if the A-MSDU subframe field of the PTP TSPEC element is 0 either in the ADDTS
 Request frame or in the ADDTS Response frame used to set up the TID. Prior to PTP TSPEC negotiation, a
 STA shall use the Basic A-MSDU subframe format if the STA employs MSDU aggregation.
 A non-PCP DMG STA in a PBSS may use an A-MSDU to forward frames to another non-PCP STA in the
 PBSS via the PCP of the PBSS if the PCP Forwarding field within the PCP’s DMG Capabilities element is
 1. A non-PCP DMG STA in a PBSS shall not use the PCP to do the forwarding if the PCP Forwarding field
 within the PCP’s DMG Capabilities element is 0.
 The Short A-MSDU subframe structure is used only between a pair of STAs that communicate directly (see
 8.3.2.1). The Short A-MSDU subframe structure cannot be used for frame forwarding.

Change the now fourth paragraph of 9.11 as follows:
An A-MSDU shall contain only MSDUs whose DA and SA parameter values map to the same RA and TA
values. For the Short A-MSDU case, an A-MSDU shall contain only MSDUs whose SA and DA parameter
values are the same.
Change the now tenth paragraph of 9.11 as follows:
The following rules apply to the transmission of an A-MSDU in a non-DMG network:
   —     A STA that has a value of false for dot11HighthroughputOptionImplemented shall not transmit an
         A-MSDU.
   —     A STA shall not transmit an A-MSDU to a STA from which it has not received a frame containing
         an HT Capabilities element.
9.12 A-MPDU operation
9.12.1 A-MPDU contents
Insert the following paragraphs at the end of 9.12.1:
A DMG STA that transmits an A-MPDU shall do so only in the Data Enabled Immediate Response context
or the Control Response context specified in Table 8-284 and Table 8-287, respectively.
The contents of an A-MPDU transmitted by a DMG STA in the data enabled immediate response context
are the ACK MPDU, or the HT-immediate BlockAck, or the Action No Ack as specified in Table 8-284.
9.12.2 A-MPDU length limit rules
Change 9.12.2 as follows:
An HT STA or a DMG STA indicates a value in the Maximum A-MPDU Length Exponent field in its HT
Capabilities element or DMG Capabilities element, respectively, that defines the maximum A-MPDU length
that it can receive. The encoding of this field is defined in Table 8-125 for an HT STA and in Table 8-183f
for a DMG STA. Using this field, the STA establishes at association the maximum length of A-MPDUs that
can be sent to it. The STA shall be capable of receiving A-MPDUs of length up to the value indicated by this
field.
An HT STA or a DMG STA shall not transmit an A-MPDU that is longer than the value indicated by the
Maximum A-MPDU Length Exponent field declared by the intended receiver.
NOTE—The A-MPDU length limit applies to the maximum length of the PSDU that might be received. If the A-MPDU
includes any padding delimiters (i.e., delimiters with the Length field equal to 0) in order to meet the MPDU start
spacing requirement, this padding is included in this length limit.
9.12.3 Minimum MPDU Start Spacing
Change 9.12.3 as follows:
An HT STA or a DMG STA shall not start the transmission of more than one MPDU within the time limit
described in the Minimum MPDU Start Spacing field declared by the intended receiver. To satisfy this
requirement, the number of octets between the start of two consecutive MPDUs in an A-MPDU, measured at
the PHY SAP, shall be equal or greater than

 where
    tMMSS       is the time (in microseconds) defined in the “Encoding” column of Table 8-125 for an HT STA

    r           is the value of the PHY Data Rate (in megabits per second) defined in Clause 21 for a DMG
                STA and defined in 20.6 for an HT STA based on the TXVECTOR parameters: MCS,
                GI_TYPE, and CH_BANDWIDTH
 If necessary, in order to satisfy this requirement, a STA shall add padding between MPDUs in an A-MPDU.
 Any such padding shall be in the form of one or more MPDU delimiters with the MPDU Length field set
 to 0.
 QoS Null frames transmitted by DMG STAs are not subject to this spacing, i.e., no MPDU delimiters with
 zero length need to be inserted after the MPDU immediately preceding the QoS Null frame in an A-MPDU.
 9.12.4 A-MPDU aggregation of group addressed data frames
 Change 9.12.4 as follows:
 An HT STA that is neither an AP nor a mesh STA shall not transmit an A-MPDU containing an PDU with a
 group addressed RA.
 NOTE—An HT AP and an HT mesh STA can transmit an A-MPDU containing MPDUs with a group addressed RA.
 An HT AP and an HT mesh STA shall not transmit an A-MPDU containing group addressed MPDUs if the
 HT Protection field is equal to non-HT mixed mode.
 A DMG STA may transmit an A-MPDU containing MPDUs with a group addressed RA.
 When an HT AP or an HT mesh STA transmits a PPDU containing at least one an A-MPDU that contains
 containing MPDUs with a group addressed RA, both of the following rules shall apply:
    —    If the PPDU is an HT PPDU, tThe value of maximum A-MPDU length exponent that applies is the
         minimum value in the Maximum A-MPDU Length Exponent subfield of the A-MPDU Parameters
         field of the HT Capabilities element across all HT STAs associated with the transmitting AP or
         across all peer HT mesh STAs of the transmitting mesh STA.
    —    If the PPDU is an HT PPDU, tThe value of minimum MPDU start spacing that applies is the
         maximum value in the Minimum MPDU Start Spacing subfield of the A-MPDU Parameters field of
         the HT Capabilities element across all HT STAs associated with the transmitting AP or across all
         peer HT mesh STAs of the transmitting mesh STA.
    —    If the PPDU is a DMG PPDU, the value of maximum A-MPDU length exponent that applies is the
         minimum value in the Maximum A-MPDU Length Exponent subfield of the A-MPDU Parameters
         field of the DMG Capabilities element across all DMG STAs associated with the PCP/AP.
    —    If the PPDU is a DMG PPDU, the value of minimum MPDU start spacing that applies is the
         maximum value in the Minimum MPDU Start Spacing subfield of the A-MPDU Parameters field of
         the DMG Capabilities element across all DMG STAs associated with the PCP/AP.

9.13 PPDU duration constraint
Insert the following paragraph at the end of 9.13:
A DMG STA shall not transmit a PPDU that has a duration (as determined by the PHY-TXTIME.confirm
primitive defined in 6.5.8) that is greater than aPPDUMaxTime.
Insert the following subclause, 9.13a, after 9.13:
9.13a DMG A-PPDU operation
A DMG STA is aggregate PPDU (A-PPDU) capable if the A-PPDU supported field within the DMG STA’s
DMG Capabilities element is 1. Otherwise, the DMG STA is A-PPDU incapable.
A DMG STA shall not transmit an A-PPDU aggregate to a STA that is not A-PPDU capable.
An A-PPDU is a sequence of two or more PPDUs transmitted without IFS, preamble, and separation
between PPDU transmissions. All PPDUs within an A-PPDU shall have the ADD-PPDU parameter of the
TXVECTOR set to ADD-PPDU, except for the last PPDU in the A-PPDU that shall have this parameter set
to NO-ADD-PPDU. The value of fields within the PLCP header of a PPDU belonging to an A-PPDU might
differ from other PPDUs in the same A-PPDU, including the MCS field.
A PPDU within an A-PPDU shall contain an A-MPDU. All MPDUs within A-MPDUs within an A-PPDU
shall have the same values for the TA and RA fields. All QoS Data MPDUs within A-MPDUs within an A-
PPDU shall have the same value of the Ack Policy subfield of the QoS Control field. If a frame that requires
an immediate response is present within an A-PPDU, it shall be transmitted in the last A-MPDU of the A-
PPDU.
The transmission duration of an A-PPDU shall be no greater than aPPDUMaxTime.
NOTE—An A-PPDU capable DMG STA that receives an A-PPDU responds with an acknowledgment frame, if
appropriate, only after it receives the last PPDU in the A-PPDU. The last PPDU in an A-PPDU has the ADD-PPDU
parameter of the TXVECTOR set to NO-ADD-PPDU.
9.18 Operation across regulatory domains
9.18.2 Operation upon entering a regulatory domain
Change the second paragraph of 9.18.2 as follows:
When a STA with dot11MultiDomainCapabilityActivated true enters a regulatory domain, before
transmitting, it shall passively scan to learn at least one valid channel, i.e., a channel upon which it detects
IEEE 802.11 frames. The Beacon frame transmitted by non-DMG STAs and DMG Beacon/Announce frame
transmitted by DMG STAs contains information on the country code, the maximum allowable transmit
power, and the channels that may be used for the regulatory domain. Optionally, these Beacon frames may
also include in the Country element, on a periodic basis, the regulatory information that would be returned in
a Probe Response frame. When DSE-dependent STA operation is required in a regulatory domain, a
dependent STA may be required to receive a Beacon frame or a DMG Beacon/Announce frame signaling
dependent enablement (10.12.5), and until this Beacon at least one of these frames is received, the STA may
continue passive scanning to receive one such a Beacon frame directly from an enabling STA. Once the
STA has acquired the information so that it is able to meet the transmit requirements of the regulatory
domain, it shall transmit a Probe Request to an PCP/AP to gain the additional necessary regulatory domain
information contained in the Probe Response frame, unless the information was previously received in a

 Beacon, DMG Beacon, or Announce frame. The STA then has sufficient information available to configure
 its PHY for operation in the regulatory domain.
 9.18.6 Operation with coverage classes
 Change 9.18.6 as follows:
 The default PHY parameters are based on aAirPropagationTime having a value of 1 μs or less, and
 aSlotTime and other MAC timing are based on the PHY timing parameters, as specified in 9.3.2.3 and 9.3.7.
 When dot11OperatingClassesRequired is true, it is possible to manage the MAC timing of STAs that can
 receive Beacon frames, DMG Beacon frames, or Probe Response frames that contain the Country element
 (8.4.2.10), to increase fairness in contending for the medium. Radio waves propagate at 300 m/μs in free
 space, and, for example, 3 μs would be the ceiling for BSS maximum one-way distance of ~450 m (~900 m
 round trip). The Coverage Class field of the Country element indicates the new value of
 aAirPropagationTime (see Table 8-56), and the MAC can use the new value to calculate aSlotTime (see
 9.3.7). When dot11OperatingClassesRequired and dot11ExtendedChannelSwitchActivated are true and
 Country elements have been received in Beacon frames, DMG Beacon frames, or Probe Response frames,
 associated STAs and dependent STAs shall use MAC timing that corresponds to the new value of
 aAirPropagationTime (see 9.3.7).
 Using the Country element, an PCP/AP can change coverage class and maximum transmit power level to
 enhance operation. When dot11OperatingClassesRequired and dot11ExtendedChannelSwitchActivated are
 true and the maximum transmit power level is different from the transmit power limit indicated by the
 operating class, the associated STA or dependent STA shall operate at a transmit power at or below that
 indicated by the lesser of the two limits.
 9.19 HCF
 9.19.1 General
 Change 9.19.1 as follows:
 Under HCF, the basic unit of allocation of the right to transmit onto the WM is the TXOP. Each TXOP is
 defined by a starting time and a defined maximum length. In a non-DMG network, tThe TXOP may be
 obtained by a STA winning an instance of EDCA contention (see 9.19.2) during the CP or by a STA
 receiving a QoS (+)CF-Poll frame (see 9.19.3) during the CP or CFP. The former is called EDCA TXOP,
 while the latter is called HCCA TXOP or polled TXOP. An HCCA TXOP shall not extend across a TBTT. A
 TXOP shall not exceed dot11MaxDwellTime (if using an FH PHY). The occurrence of a TBTT implies the
 end of the HCCA TXOP, after which the regular channel access procedure (EDCA or HCCA) is resumed. It
 is possible that no frame was transmitted during the TXOP. The shortened termination of the HCCA TXOP
 does not imply an error condition.
 In a DMG BSS, the EDCAF operates only during CBAPs. Operation of the EDCAF is suspended at the end
 of a CBAP and is resumed at the beginning of the following CBAP. When the EDCAF is being suspended,
 the values of the backoff and NAV timers shall remain unchanged until the start of the following CBAP. A
 TXOP may be obtained only within a CBAP. A TXOP may be obtained by a DMG STA winning an
 instance of EDCA contention (see 9.19.2) or by a DMG STA receiving a Grant frame with the
 AllocationType field equal to 1. See 9.33.5 and 9.33.6.3 for additional rules regarding contention-based
 access in DMG BSSs.
 HCCA is not used by DMG STAs.

9.19.2 HCF contention-based channel access (EDCA)
9.19.2.1 Reference implementation
Insert the following paragraph and note at the end of 9.19.2.1:
A DMG STA may implement a single AC. If the DMG STA implements a single AC, all UP and frame
types shall be mapped to AC_BE.
NOTE—A DMG STA that implements a single AC has only one queue in Figure 9-19.
9.19.2.5 EDCA backoff procedure
Insert the following list item at the end of the lettered list of the third paragraph of 9.19.2.5:
   e)    The transmission attempt of a STA coordinated by an MM-SME collides internally with another
         STA coordinated by the same MM-SME (see 10.33), which is indicated to the first MAC entity with
         a PHY-TxBusy.indication (BUSY) as response to the PHY-TXSTART.request primitive.
Change the first sentence in the eighth paragraph of 9.19.2.5 as follows:
If the backoff procedure is invoked because of a failure event [reason c) or d) or e) above or the transmission
failure of a non-initial frame by the TXOP holder], the value of CW[AC] shall be updated as follows before
invoking the backoff procedure:
9.19.2.7 Truncation of TXOP
Change 9.19.2.7 as follows:
When a STA gains access to the channel using EDCA and empties its transmission queue, it may transmit a
CF-End frame provided that the remaining duration is long enough to transmit this frame. By transmitting
the CF-End frame, the STA is explicitly indicating the completion of its TXOP. In a DMG BSS, the STA
shall not send a CF-End with a nonzero value in the Duration/ID field if the remaining duration is shorter
than 2×TXTIME(CF-End) + 2×SIFS.
A TXOP holder that transmits a CF-End frame shall not initiate any further frame exchange sequences
within the current TXOP.
A non-AP STA that is not the TXOP holder shall not transmit a CF-End frame.
In a non-DMG network, aA STA shall interpret the reception of a CF-End frame as a NAV reset, i.e., it
resets its NAV timer to 0 at the end of the PPDU containing this frame. After receiving a CF-End frame with
a matching BSSID, an AP may respond by transmitting a CF-End frame after SIFS.
NOTE—The transmission of a single CF-End frame by the TXOP holder resets the NAV of STAs hearing the TXOP
holder. There may be STAs that could hear the TXOP responder that had set their NAV that do not hear this NAV reset.
Those STAs are prevented from contending for the medium until the original NAV reservation expires.
In a DMG BSS, a STA that is not in the Listening Mode (9.33.6.6) shall interpret the reception of a CF-End
frame as a NAV reset, i.e., it resets its NAV timer to 0 at the end of the time interval indicated in the value of
the Duration/ID field of the received frame. The interval starts at PHY-RXEND.indication of the frame
reception. The STA shall not transmit during the interval if the RA field of the frame is not equal to the STA
MAC address. The STA may transmit a CF-End frame if the RA field of the received frame is equal to the
STA MAC address and the value of the Duration/ID field in the received frame is not equal to 0.

Std 802.11ad-2012                              LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 Figure 9-21 shows an example of TXOP truncation. In this example, the STA accesses the medium using
 EDCA channel access and then transmits a nav-set sequence (e.g., RTS/CTS for non-DMG STAs or RTS/
 DMG CTS for DMG STAs) (using the terminology of Annex G). After a SIFS, it then transmits an initiator-
 sequence, which may involve the exchange of multiple PPDUs between the TXOP holder and a TXOP
 responder. At the end of the second sequence, the TXOP holder has no more data that it can available to send
 that fits within the TXOP; therefore, it truncates the TXOP by transmitting a CF-End frame.
 Figure 9-21 remains unchanged.
 Non-DMG STAs that receive a CF-End frame reset their NAV and can start contending for the medium
 without further delay. DMG STAs that receive a CF-End frame can start contending for the medium at the
 end of the time interval equal to the value in Duration/ID field of the frame if none of its NAV timers has a
 nonzero value (9.33.10).
 TXOP truncation shall not be used in combination with L-SIG TXOP protection when the HT Protection
 field of the HT Operation element is equal to nonmember protection mode or non-HT mixed mode.
 9.21 Block Acknowledgment (Block Ack)
 9.21.1 Introduction
 Change the second and third paragraphs of 9.21.1 as follows:
 The Block Ack mechanism is initialized by an exchange of ADDBA Request/Response frames. After
 initialization, blocks of QoS data frames may be transmitted from the originator to the recipient. A block
 may be started within a polled TXOP, within an SP, or by winning EDCA contention. The number of frames
 in the block is limited, and the amount of state that is to be kept by the recipient is bounded. The MPDUs
 within the block of frames are acknowledged by a BlockAck control frame, which is requested by a
 BlockAckReq frame.
 The Block Ack mechanism does not require the setting up of a TS; however, QoS STAs using the TS facility
 may choose to signal their intention to use Block Ack mechanism for the scheduler’s consideration in
 assigning TXOPs. The Block Ack mechanism is also used by the GCR service. Acknowledgments of frames
 belonging to the same TID, but transmitted during multiple TXOPs/SPs, may also be combined into a single
 BlockAck frame. This mechanism allows the originator to have flexibility regarding the transmission of data
 MPDUs. The originator may split the block of frames across TXOPs/SPs, separate the data transfer and the
 Block Ack exchange, and interleave blocks of MPDUs carrying all or part of MSDUs or A-MSDUs for
 different TIDs or RAs.
 Insert the following paragraph after the third paragraph of 9.21.1:
 A DMG STA shall support the HT-Immediate Block Ack extension. A DMG STA shall not use the HT-
 Delayed Block Ack extension.
 9.21.2 Setup and modification of the Block Ack parameters
 Change the fifth paragraph of 9.21.2 as follows:
 When a Block Ack agreement is established between two HT/DMG STAs, the originator may change the
 size of its transmission window if the value in the Buffer Size field of the ADDBA Response frame is larger
 than the value in the ADDBA Request frame. If the value in the Buffer Size field of the ADDBA Response
 frame is smaller than the value in the ADDBA Request frame, the originator shall change the size of its
 240                                                                     Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

transmission window (WinSizeO) so that it is not greater than the value in the Buffer Size field of the
ADDBA Response frame and is not greater than the value 64.
9.21.3 Data and acknowledgment transfer using immediate Block Ack policy and delayed
Block Ack policy
Change the second and third paragraphs of 9.21.3 as follows:
Subject to any constraints in this subclause about permitted use of TXOP or SP according to the channel
access mechanism used, the originator may
   —     Separate the Block and Basic BlockAckReq frames into separate TXOPs or SPs
   —     Split a Block frame across multiple TXOPs or SPs
   —     Split transmission of data MPDUs sent under Block Ack policy across multiple TXOPs or SPs
   —     Interleave MPDUs with different TIDs within the same TXOP or SP
   —     Sequence or interleave MPDUs for different RAs within a TXOP or SP
A protective mechanism (such as transmitting using HCCA, RTS/CTS, RTS/DMG CTS, SP, Protected
Period, or the mechanism described in 9.23) should be used to reduce the probability of other STAs
transmitting during the TXOP or SP. If no protective mechanism is used, then the first frame that is sent as a
block shall have a response frame and shall have the Duration field set so that the NAVs are set to
appropriate values at all STAs in the BSS.
Change the 13th paragraph in 9.21.3 as follows:
If there is no response (i.e., neither a Basic BlockAck nor an ACK frame) to the Basic BlockAckReq frame,
the originator may retransmit the Basic BlockAckReq frame within the current TXOP or SP (if time permits)
or within a subsequent TXOP or SP. MSDUs that are sent using the Block Ack mechanism are not subject to
retry limits but only to MSDU lifetime. Non-DMG The originators need not set the retry bit to 1 for any
possible retransmissions of the MPDUs. DMG originators shall set the retry bit to 1 for any possible
retransmissions of the MPDUs.
9.21.6 Selection of BlockAck and BlockAckReq variants
Insert the following paragraphs after the second paragraph (“The Multi-TID subfield ....”) of 9.21.6:
In a DMG BSS, if the Compressed Bitmap subfield of the BAR Control field within a BlockAckReq frame
related to an HT-immediate agreement is equal to 1, then all the following BlockAck and BlockAckReq
frames transmitted as part of the HT-immediate agreement shall have the Compressed Bitmap subfield of
the BA Control and BAR Control fields set to 1. In this case, the Multi-TID subfield of the BA Control field
and BAR Control field shall be set to 0 in all BlockAck and BlockAckReq frames transmitted as part of the
HT-immediate agreement.
In a DMG BSS, if the Compressed Bitmap subfield of the BAR Control field within a BlockAckReq frame
related to an HT-immediate agreement is equal to 0, then all the following BlockAck and BlockAckReq
frames transmitted as part of the HT-immediate agreement shall have the Compressed Bitmap subfield of
the BA Control and BAR Control fields set to 0. In this case, the Multi-TID subfield of the BA Control field
and BAR Control field shall be set to 1 in all BlockAck and BlockAckReq frames transmitted as part of the
HT-immediate agreement.

 9.21.7 HT-immediate Block Ack extensions
 9.21.7.2 HT-immediate Block Ack architecture
 Insert the following subclause title immediately after the title of 9.21.7.2 for all the existing subclause text
 (“The HT-immediate Block Ack rules ... the HT-immediate Block Ack agreement is still active.”)
 (including Figure 9-28):
 9.21.7.2.1 Introduction
 Insert the following subclause, 9.21.7.2.2, after 9.21.7.2.1:
 9.21.7.2.2 Data and acknowledgment transfer
 Under a BA agreement, the Normal ACK policy may be used in order to improve efficiency. STAs shall
 respond with an ACK to the reception of frames that are covered by a BA agreement, but that are not part of
 an A-MPDU and that are received with their Ack Policy subfield in the QoS Control field equal to Normal
 Ack.
 The Block Ack record shall be updated irrespective of the acknowledgment type (Normal or Block ACK)
 for the TID/TSID with a Block Ack agreement.
 The reception of QoS data frames using Normal Ack policy shall not be used by the recipient as an
 indication to reset the timer employed in detecting a Block Ack timeout (see 10.5). The Block Ack timeout
 allows the recipient to delete the Block Ack if the originator does not switch back to using Block Ack.
 Change the title of 9.21.7.5 as follows:
 9.21.7.5 Generation and transmission of BlockAck by an HT or DMG STA
 9.21.7.6 Receive reordering buffer control operation
 9.21.7.6.2 Operation for each received data MPDU
 Change list item a) 2) of the first paragraph in 9.21.7.6.2 as follows:
    a)    If WinStartB ≤ SN ≤ WinEndB,
          2)   Pass MSDUs or A-MSDUs up to the next MAC process if they that are stored in the buffer in
               order of increasing value of the Sequence Number subfield starting with the MSDU or A-
               MSDU that has SN=WinStartB or one of the following conditions is met for a DMG STA if
               SN>WinStartB:
               i)   The MPDU is received as non-first frame in the A-MPDU; the bit at position
                    SN=WinStartR – 1 is set to 1; and all delimiters between the received MPDU and the
                    preceding MPDU (SN=WinStartR – 1) are valid.
               ii)  The MPDU is received as first frame in the A-MPDU; the A-MPDU is received in SIFS or
                    RIFS time after an A-MPDU or in SIFS time after transmission of a BA frame; the bit at
                    position SN=WinStartR – 1 is set to 1; and all delimiters after the MPDU(SN=WinStartR
                    – 1) in the preceding A-MPDU are valid.
               iii) The MPDU is received in SIFS or RIFS time after an A-MPDU or in SIFS time after
                    transmission of a BA frame; the bit at position SN=WinStartR – 1 is set to 1; and all
                    delimiters after the MPDU (SN=WinStartR – 1) in the preceding A-MPDU are valid.

              iv) The MPDU is received as first frame in the A-MPDU; the A-MPDU is received in SIFS or
                   RIFS time after an MPDU or in SIFS time after transmission of an Ack frame; and the bit
                   at position SN=WinStartR – 1 is set to 1.
              v)   The MPDU is received in SIFS or RIFS time after the preceding MPDU or in SIFS time
                   after transmission of an Ack frame; and the bit at position SN=WinStartR – 1 is set to 1.
              This process is continued and proceeding sequentially until there is no buffered MSDU or A-
              MSDU for the next sequential value of the Sequence Number subfield.
Change list item b) 5) of the first paragraph of 9.21.7.6.2 as follows:
   b)    If WinEndB < SN < WinStartB+211,
         5)   For a non-DMG STA, pPass MSDUs or A-MSDUs stored in the buffer up to the next MAC
              process in order of increasing value of the Sequence Number subfield starting with WinStartB
              and proceeding sequentially until there is no buffered MSDU or A-MSDU for the next
              sequential Sequence Number subfield value. For a DMG STA, follow rules defined in item a)
              2) above.
9.21.7.7 Originator’s behavior
Insert the following paragraphs at the end of 9.21.7.7:
The Originator that is a DMG STA shall construct A-MPDUs that contain MPDUs in increasing order of
SN. When responding to a Block Ack, the Originator shall first retransmit unacknowledged MPDUs in
increasing order of SN.
The Originator that is a DMG STA shall not start a new TXOP or SP with an MPDU or A-MPDU that has
an ACK policy other than Normal ACK if at least one frame transmitted by the Originator to the Recipient in
the last PPDU did not require an immediate response.
9.24 MAC frame processing
9.24.3 Duration/ID field processing
Change the first paragraph of 9.24.3 as follows:
When the contents of a received Duration/ID field, treated as an unsigned integer and without regard for
address values, type, and subtype (even when type or subtype contain reserved values), are less than 32 768,
the duration value is used to update the network allocation vector (NAV) according to the procedures
defined in 9.3.2.4, 9.33.10, or 9.19.3.4, as appropriate.
9.25 Reverse Direction protocol
Insert the following subclause, 9.25.0a, before 9.25.1:
9.25.0a General
The RD protocol may be supported by an HT STA and by a DMG STA. The normative behavior of the RD
protocol defined in this subclause applies to both types of STAs. For an HT STA, the RDG/More PPDU
subfield and the AC Constraint subfield are present in the HTC field, and for a DMG STA, the RDG/More
PPDU subfield and the AC Constraint subfield are present in the QoS Control field.

 9.25.1 Reverse Direction (RD) exchange sequence
 Change item a) of the first paragraph of 9.25.1 as follows:
    a)    The transmission of a PPDU by a TXOP holder or SP source containing an RD grant (the RDG
          PPDU), which is indicated by the PPDU containing one or more +HTC/DMG MPDUs in which the
          RDG/More PPDU subfield is equal to 1. The STA that transmits this PPDU is known as the RD
          initiator. The rules for an RD initiator apply only during a single RD exchange sequence, i.e., after
          the transmission of an RDG PPDU and up to the end of the last PPDU in the RD exchange sequence.
 Change the note after the first paragraph in 9.25.1 as follows:
 NOTE—An RD initiator might include multiple RD exchange sequences within a single TXOP or SP. Each RD
 exchange sequence within a single TXOP or SP might be addressed to a different recipient, and any single recipient
 might be given more than one RDG within a single TXOP or SP.
 9.25.2 Support for RD
 Change 9.25.2 as follows:
 Support of the RD feature is an option for an HT STA and a DMG STA. It is optional in the sense that a
 TXOP holder or SP source is never required to generate an RDG, and a STA receiving an RDG is never
 required to use the grant.
 An HT STA indicates sSupport of the RD feature as an RD responder is indicated using the RD Responder
 subfield of the HT Extended Capabilities field of the HT Capabilities element. A STA shall set the RD
 Responder subfield to 1 in frames that it transmits containing the HT Capabilities element if
 dot11RDResponderOptionImplemented is true. Otherwise, the STA shall set the RD Responder subfield
 to 0.
 A DMG STA indicates support of the RD feature using the Reverse Direction subfield of the DMG STA
 Capability Information field of the DMG Capabilities element. A STA shall set the Reverse Direction
 subfield to 1 in frames that it transmits containing the DMG Capabilities element if
 dot11RDResponderOptionImplemented is true. Otherwise, the STA shall set the Reverse Direction subfield
 to 0.
 9.25.3 Rules for RD initiator
 Change the third to sixth paragraphs in 9.25.3 as follows:
 Transmission of a +HTC/DMG frame by an RD initiator with the RDG/More PPDU subfield equal to 1
 (either transmitted as a non-A-MPDU frame or within an A-MPDU) indicates that the duration indicated by
 the Duration/ID field is available for the RD response burst and RD initiator final PPDU (if present).
 An RD initiator that sets the RDG/More PPDU field to 1 in a +HTC/DMG frame shall set the AC Constraint
 subfield to 1 in that frame if the allocation is a TXOP and the TXOP was gained through the EDCA channel
 access mechanism and shall otherwise set it to 0.
 An RD initiator shall not transmit a +HTC/DMG frame with the RDG/More PPDU subfield set to 1 that
 requires a response MPDU that is not one of the following:
    —     Ack
    —     Compressed BlockAck
 244                                                                     Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

Subject to TXOP or SP constraints, after transmitting an RDG PPDU, an RD initiator may transmit its next
PPDU as follows:
   a)    Normal continuation: The RD initiator may transmit its next PPDU a minimum of a SIFS after
         receiving a response PPDU that meets one of the following conditions:
         1)    Contains one or more correctly received +HTC/DMG frames with the RDG/More PPDU
               subfield equal to 0, or
         2)    For an HT STA, cContains one or more correctly received frames that are capable of carrying
               the HT Control field but did not contain an HT Control field, or
         3)    Contains a correctly received frame that requires an immediate response, or
         4)    For a DMG STA, none of the correctly received frames in the PPDU carry the QoS Control
               field.
   b)    Error recovery: The RD initiator may transmit its next PPDU when the CS mechanism (see 9.3.2.2)
         indicates that the medium is idle at the TxPIFS slot boundary (defined in 9.3.7) (this transmission is
         a continuation of the current TXOP or SP).
Change and number the following note, and insert a new note at the end of 9.25.3:
NOTE 1—In a non-DMG network tThe RD initiator can transmit a CF-End frame according to the rules for TXOP
truncation in 9.19.2.7 following a RD transmit sequence. An RD responder never transmits a CF-End.
NOTE 2—In a DMG network, the RD initiator can transmit a CF-End frame according to the rules for TXOP truncation
in 9.19.2.7 or SP truncation in 9.33.8, as appropriate, following a RD transmit sequence. An RD responder never
transmits a CF-End.
9.25.4 Rules for RD responder
Change 9.25.4 as follows:
An RD responder shall transmit the initial PPDU of the RD response burst a SIFS after the reception of the
RDG PPDU. PPDUs in a response burst are separated by SIFS or RIFS. The RIFS rules in the RD are the
same as in the forward direction; the use of RIFS is constrained as defined in 9.3.2.3.2 and 9.23.3.3.
NOTE—The transmission of a response by the RD responder does not constitute a new channel access but a
continuation of the RD initiator’s TXOP or SP. An RD responder ignores the NAV when responding to an RDG.
The recipient of an RDG may decline the RDG by
   —     Not transmitting any frames following the RDG PPDU when no response is otherwise required, or
   —     Transmitting a control response frame with the RDG/More PPDU subfield set to 0, or
   —     Transmitting a control response frame that contains no HT Control field
An RD responder that is a non-DMG STA may transmit a +CF-ACK non-A-MPDU frame in response to a
non-A-MPDU QoS Data +HTC MPDU that has the Ack Policy field set to Normal Ack and the RDG/More
PPDU subfield equal to 1.
The RD responder shall ensure verify that its PPDU transmission(s) and any expected responses fit entirely
within the remaining TXOP or SP duration, as indicated in the Duration/ID field of MPDUs within the RDG
PPDU.
An RD responder shall not transmit an MPDU (either individually or aggregated within an A-MPDU) that is
not one of the following:
   —     ACK

    —      QoS data
    —      Management
 If the AC Constraint subfield is equal to 1, the RD responder shall transmit data frames of only the same AC
 as the last frame received from the RD initiator. For a BlockAckReq or BlockAck frame, the AC is
 determined by examining the TID field. For a management frame, the AC is AC_VO. The RD initiator shall
 not transmit a +HTC/DMG MPDU with the RDG/More PPDU subfield set to 1 from which the AC cannot
 be determined. If the AC Constraint subfield is equal to 0, the RD responder may transmit data frames of any
 TID.
 During an RDG, the RD responder shall not transmit any frames with an Address 1 field that does not match
 the MAC address of the RD initiator.
 If an RDG PPDU also requires an immediate BlockAck response, the BlockAck response frame shall be
 included in the first PPDU of the response.
 When a PPDU is not the final PPDU of a response burst, an HT Control field carrying the RDG/More PPDU
 subfield set to 1 shall be present in every MPDU within the PPDU capable of carrying the HT Control field,
 or if the PPDU is transmitted in a DMG BSS, the RDG/More PPDU subfield within the QoS Control field
 shall be set to 1 in every MPDU within the PPDU. The last PPDU of a response burst shall have the RDG/
 More PPDU subfield set to 0 in all +HTC/DMG MPDUs contained in that PPDU.
 The RD responder shall not set the RDG/More PPDU subfield to 1 in any MPDU in a PPDU that contains an
 MPDU that requires an immediate response.
 NOTE—If the RD responder transmits a PPDU that expects a transmission by the RD initiator after SIFS and no such
 transmission is detected, the RD responder has to wait for either another RDG or its own TXOP or SP before it can retry
 the exchange.
 After transmitting a PPDU containing one or more +HTC/DMG MPDUs in which the RDG/More PPDU
 subfield is equal to 0, the RD responder shall not transmit any more PPDUs within the current response
 burst.
 NOTE 1—If an RD-capable STA that is not the TXOP holder or SP source receives a PPDU that does not indicate an
 RDG, there is no difference in its response compared to a STA that is not RD-capable.
 NOTE 2—The RD responder can set the RDG/More PPDU subfield to 1 in response to a frame sent by the RD initiator
 that has the RDG/More PPDU subfield equal to 0.

Insert the following subclauses, 9.33 through 9.39.4 (including Figure 9-43 through Figure 9-80 and
Table 9-16), after 9.32.9:
9.33 DMG channel access
9.33.1 General
Channel access by a DMG STA occurs during beacon intervals and is coordinated using a schedule. A DMG
STA operating as a PCP or AP generates the schedule and communicates it to STAs using DMG Beacon and
Announce frames. A non-PCP STA that is a non-AP STA and that receives scheduling information accesses
the medium during the scheduled periods using the access rules specific to that period. Medium access rules
to establish a BSS are defined in 9.34 and 10.1.4.
In the ATI, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall be ready to receive a transmission from the PCP/AP at least
RxAdvanceTime before the expected transmission of a request frame. The destination STA of an SP shall be
ready to receive a transmission from the source STA of the SP at least RxAdvanceTime before the start of
the SP. A STA that participates in a CBAP shall be ready to receive a transmission within the CBAP at least
RxAdvanceTime before the start of the CBAP plus DIFS. In the A-BFT, the PCP/AP should be ready to
receive a transmission from a non-PCP/non-AP STA at least RxAdvanceTime before the start of an SSW
slot. In all the preceding rules, RxAdvanceTime is defined as follows:
   RxAdvanceTime = ceiling ([ClockAccuracy (ppm) × 10-6] × DriftInterval + aAirPropagationTime,
   aTSFResolution)
where
   DriftInterval              is the time elapsed since a synchronizing reference event. The synchronizing
                              event is the reception of the Timestamp field from the PCP/AP.
9.33.2 Access periods within a beacon interval
Medium time within a DMG BSS is divided into beacon intervals. Subdivisions within the beacon interval
are called access periods. Different access periods within a beacon interval have different access rules. The
access periods are described in a schedule that is communicated by the PCP or AP to the non-PCP and non-
AP STAs within the BSS. The schedule communicated by the PCP or AP can include the following access
periods:
   —     BTI: An access period during which one or more DMG Beacon frames is transmitted. Not all DMG
         Beacon frames are detectable by all non-PCP and non-AP STAs. Not all beacon intervals contain a
         BTI. A non-PCP STA that is a non-AP STA shall not transmit during the BTI of the BSS of which it
         is a member.
   —     A-BFT: An access period during which beamforming training is performed with the STA that
         transmitted a DMG Beacon frame during the preceding BTI. The presence of the A-BFT is optional
         and signaled in DMG Beacon frames.
   —     ATI: A request-response based management access period between PCP/AP and non-PCP/non-AP
         STAs. The presence of the ATI is optional and signaled in DMG Beacon frames.
   —     DTI: An access period during which frame exchanges are performed between STAs. There is a
         single DTI per beacon interval.
The DTI, in turn, comprises contention-based access periods (CBAPs) and scheduled service periods (SPs).

 9.33.3 ATI transmission rules
 The presence of an ATI in the current beacon interval is signaled by the ATI Present field set to 1 in the
 current DMG Beacon (8.3.4.1). The Next DMG ATI element (8.4.2.137) transmitted in the Announce frame
 or in the DMG Beacon frame indicates the earliest start time for the next ATI in a subsequent beacon
 interval and ATI duration.
 An example of an ATI is shown in Figure 9-44.

                      Figure 9-44—Example of frame exchanges during the ATI
 During an ATI, request and response frames are exchanged between the PCP/AP and any subset of STAs.
 The PCP/AP initiates all frame exchanges that occur during the ATI. The ATI shall not start sooner than
 Max(guard time, MBIFS) following the end of the previous A-BFT when an A-BFT is present in the beacon
 interval or following the end of the previous BTI when an A-BFT is not present but a BTI is present in the

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                     Std 802.11ad-2012
beacon interval. The ATI shall not start before TBTT if the ATI is the first period in the beacon interval (the
ATI is never the first period in the beacon interval in an infrastructure BSS; see 10.1.2.1). Once the ATI
starts, the PCP/AP may start transmission of a request frame immediately or it may delay the transmission of
the request frame if the medium is determined by the CCA mechanism to be busy.
During each ATI the PCP/AP shall schedule transmissions to a non-PCP/non-AP STA if the non-PCP/non-
AP STA Heartbeat field in the STA’s DMG Capabilities element within the Association Request frame of
the last successful association attempt is 1 and the non-PCP/non-AP STA is in the Awake state. If the non-
PCP/non-AP STA does not respond to the frame transmitted by the PCP/AP, the PCP/AP shall use the DMG
Control modulation class (9.7.5a.1) at its next transmission attempt to the non-PCP/non-AP STA. The PCP/
AP shall use the DMG Control modulation class for all subsequent transmissions to the non-PCP/non-AP
STA until it receives a valid frame from the non-PCP/non-AP STA.
A non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not transmit during the ATI except in response to a received individually
addressed frame whose TA field contains the PCP/AP’s MAC address and whose RA field contains the
STA’s MAC address.
During the ATI STAs shall not transmit frames that are not request or response frames. Request and
response frames transmitted during the ATI shall be one of the following:
   —      A frame of type Management
   —      An ACK frame
   —      A Grant, Poll, RTS or DMG CTS frame when transmitted as a request frame
   —      An SPR or DMG CTS frame when transmitted as a response frame
   —      A frame of type Data only as part of an authentication exchange to reach a RSNA security
          association
NOTE—The Announce frame is designed to be used primarily during the ATI and can perform functions of a DMG
Beacon frame.
The transmission of Poll frames during the ATI follows the rules described in 9.33.7. The Response Offset
field within a Poll frame transmitted during the ATI shall be set to 0.
Individually addressed request frames transmitted during the ATI shall not be sent using management
frames of subtype action no ACK.
During the ATI, after a PCP/AP transmits an individually addressed request frame (such as an Announce
frame) to a non-PCP/non-AP STA, and the STA receives that frame, the STA shall transmit a response
frame addressed to the PCP/AP. The transmission of the response frame shall commence one SIFS period
after the successful reception of the request frame. The PCP/AP shall interpret the receipt of the response
frame as an acknowledgment of the request frame. Response frames transmitted by non-PCP/non-AP STAs
during the ATI shall be individually addressed to the PCP/AP.
NOTE—STAs do not transmit a response frame to the PCP/AP when they receive a request frame from the PCP/AP
with the RA equal to a group address (see 9.3.2.9 and 9.3.6).
The Duration field of a request frame transmitted during the ATI shall be set to cover the remaining duration
of the ATI at the end of the request frame transmission. The Duration field of a response frame transmitted
during the ATI shall be set to the value of the Duration field within the previously received request frame
minus SIFS and minus the duration of the response frame transmission.
When a transmission by a STA is expected by a PCP/AP and a SIFS period elapses without its receipt, the
PCP/AP may either repeat its individually addressed transmission to that STA or, as early as one PIFS after
the end of its previous transmission, transmit a frame to any other STA.

 NOTE—If acknowledgment is required, the PCP/AP transmits an ACK frame to acknowledge the reception of a
 response frame during the ATI (see Figure 9-44).
 Multiple request and response frame exchanges between the PCP/AP and a STA might occur during a single
 ATI.
 During the ATI the PCP/AP should schedule transmissions to non-PCP/non-AP STAs in power save mode
 before transmissions to non-PCP/non-AP STAs that are not in power save mode.
 9.33.4 DTI transmission rules
 During the DTI, a STA may transmit frames (following the DMG channel access rules) if any of the
 following conditions are met:
    a)    During a CBAP for which the STA is identified or included as source or destination
          (9.33.6.3, 9.33.7, and 9.33.8)
    b)    During an SP for which the STA is identified as source or destination (9.33.6.2 and 9.33.7)
 and shall not transmit if none of these conditions are met. A STA initiating data transfer shall check that the
 transaction, including acknowledgments, completes before the end of the CBAP or SP in which it was
 initiated.
 When the entire DTI is allocated to CBAP (that is, the CBAP Only field is 1 in the DMG Parameters field),
 the ATI Present field within the DMG Beacon containing the DMG Parameters field shall be set to 0.
 Non-PCP/non-AP DMG STAs shall be capable of processing the Poll and Grant frames and the Extended
 Schedule element. A PCP/AP shall be capable of processing the SPR frame transmitted by a non-PCP/non-
 AP STA and responding to a SPR frame with a Grant frame.
 The DMG low-power SC PHY (21.7) may be used only within SPs that have the LP SC Used subfield
 within the Extended Schedule element equal to 1 and shall not be used otherwise. A STA supports the DMG
 low-power SC PHY if the Low-Power SC PHY Supported subfield within its DMG Capabilities element is
 1. A STA that supports the DMG low-power SC PHY shall not transmit a PPDU using the DMG low-power
 SC PHY unless the STAs identified in the RA field of all MPDUs contained within the PPDU support the
 DMG low-power SC PHY. A STA can use the procedure described in 10.29.1 to discover the capabilities of
 another STA.
 9.33.5 Contention-based access period (CBAP) transmission rules
 The definition of contention-based transmission rules used within a CBAP is provided in 9.3 and in 9.19.
 This subclause specifies additional rules applicable to the CBAP.
 A STA shall not transmit within a CBAP unless at least one of the following conditions is met:
    —     The value of the CBAP Only field is equal to 1 and the value of the CBAP Source field is equal to 0
          within the DMG Parameters field of the DMG Beacon that allocates the CBAP
    —     The STA is a PCP/AP and the value of the CBAP Only field is equal to 1 and the value of the CBAP
          Source field is equal to 1 within the DMG Parameters field of the DMG Beacon that allocates the
          CBAP
    —     The value of the Source AID field of the CBAP is equal to the broadcast AID
    —     The STA’s AID is equal to the value of the Source AID field of the CBAP
    —     The STA’s AID is equal to the value of the Destination AID field of the CBAP
 250                                                                   Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

If a STA’s AID is equal to the value of the Source AID field of a CBAP allocation or if a STA performs in
the role of PCP/AP and both the CBAP Only and CBAP Source fields are equal to 1 in the DMG Beacon
that allocates a CBAP, the STA may initiate a frame transmission within the CBAP immediately after the
medium is determined to be idle for one PIFS period.
A BF initiator (9.35) should not initiate an SLS phase within a CBAP if there is not enough time within the
CBAP to complete the SLS phase.
A STA shall not extend a transmission frame exchange sequence that started during a CBAP beyond the end
of that CBAP. A STA that initiates a sequence shall check that the frame exchange sequence, including any
control frame responses, completes before the end of the CBAP.
At the beginning of a TXOP with a TXOP responder that has the Heartbeat field in the TXOP responder’s
DMG Capabilities element equal to 1, the following rules apply:
   —     The TXOP holder shall transmit a frame to the TXOP responder using the DMG Control modulation
         class before it uses any other modulation class for transmission if the time elapsed since the last
         frame received from the TXOP responder is larger than or equal to the Heartbeat Elapsed Time
         value computed using the Heartbeat Elapsed Indication field within the TXOP responder’s DMG
         Capabilities element.
   —     The TXOP holder may transmit a frame using a modulation class other than the DMG Control
         modulation class at the start of the TXOP if the time elapsed since the last frame received from the
         TXOP responder is shorter than the Heartbeat Elapsed Time value computed using the Heartbeat
         Elapsed Indication field within the TXOP responder’s DMG Capabilities element.
The frame sent by the STA at the beginning of the TXOP may be an RTS or a DMG CTS-To-Self.
Within a CBAP a STA with multiple DMG antennas should use only one DMG antenna in its frame
transmission, CCA and frame reception, except if it is the initiator or responder in an SLS (9.35). The
algorithm to select a DMG antenna and switch the active DMG antenna is implementation dependent.
Within CBAPs a STA that changed to a different DMG antenna in order to transmit should perform CCA on
that DMG antenna until a frame sequence is detected by which it can correctly set its NAV, or until a period
of time equal to the dot11DMGProbeDelay has transpired, whichever is earlier.
9.33.6 Channel access in scheduled DTI
9.33.6.1 General
The PCP/AP schedules each allocation with a specified start time from the TSF and with a fixed duration.
An allocation can be an SP, where ownership of channel time is granted to a single STA, or a CBAP, where
STAs can compete for channel access. The PCP/AP shall reference the start time of each allocation from the
TSF.
The PCP/AP may schedule SPs or CBAPs only during the DTI of a beacon interval, following the end of an
allocated BTI, A-BFT, and ATI when any of these periods are present in the beacon interval.
The schedule of the DTI of a beacon interval is communicated through the Extended Schedule element. The
PCP/AP shall transmit the Extended Schedule element in either or both an Announce frame or a DMG
Beacon frame. The Extended Schedule element shall contain the scheduling information of all allocations in
the DTI. The same Allocation field shall not appear more than once in the Extended Schedule element
transmitted in a beacon interval. The content of the Extended Schedule element communicated in a beacon
interval shall not change if transmitted more than once in the beacon interval, except that if the STA
transmitting the Extended Schedule element is a PCP with multiple DMG antennas then the value of the
PCP Active field of CBAP allocations within the Extended Schedule element might change when this

 element is transmitted through different DMG antennas. The PCP/AP should schedule SPs for a STA such
 that the scheduled SPs do not overlap in time with the traffic scheduling constraints indicated by this STA in
 the TSCONST field of the associated DMG TSPEC element.
 When scheduling a nonpseudo-static SP or changing the start time of an existing pseudo-static SP that has a
 non-PCP/non-AP STA as a source DMG STA or as a destination DMG STA of the SP, a PCP/AP shall set
 the start time of the SP to no less than aMinAllocationDeliveryTime after the last Extended Schedule
 element containing this SP is transmitted by the PCP/AP.
 NOTE—This rule does not apply to the case when a PCP/AP schedules a new pseudo-static SP.
 An SP or CBAP allocation within an Extended Schedule element may comprise one or more individual
 allocations. The start time of each individual allocation of an SP or CBAP is given by
    (A_start + (i – 1) × A_period)
 where
    A_start is the value of the Allocation Start field for the SP or CBAP
    A_period is the value of the Allocation Block Period field for the SP or CBAP
    i           is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to the value of the Number of Blocks field for
                the SP or CBAP
 The end of the ith individual SP or CBAP allocation is computed by adding the start time of the ith individual
 allocation to the value of the Allocation Block Duration field for the corresponding SP or CBAP allocation.
 If the PCP Active subfield in the Allocation field for an allocation within an Extended Schedule element is
 1, the PCP shall be in the receive state for the duration of that allocation, except when transmitting during
 that allocation. The AP shall set the PCP Active field to one for every allocation within an Extended
 Schedule element transmitted by the AP.
 9.33.6.2 Service period (SP) allocation
 The PCP/AP shall set the AllocationType subfield to 0 in an Allocation field within an Extended Schedule
 element to indicate an SP allocation.
 An SP is assigned to the source DMG STA identified in the Source AID subfield in an Allocation field
 within the Extended Schedule element. The source DMG STA shall initiate the frame exchange sequence
 that takes place during the SP at the start of the SP, except when the source DMG STA intends to establish a
 DMG Protected Period in which case the rules described in 9.33.6.6 shall be followed before the source
 DMG STA initiates the frame exchange in the SP. The SP allocation identifies the TC or TS for which the
 allocation is made; however, the type of traffic transmitted is not restricted to the specified TC or TS
 (10.4.1).
 Except when transmitting a frame as part of the SP recovery procedure (9.33.6.7) or transmitting a response
 to the source DMG STA or transmitting a PPDU as part of a RD response burst (9.25), the STA identified by
 the Destination AID field in the Extended Schedule element should be in the receive state for the duration of
 the SP in order to receive transmissions from the source DMG STA. If the Destination AID field of the
 scheduled SP is equal to the broadcast AID and if the Source AID field of the scheduled SP is not equal to
 the broadcast AID, then all STAs on the PBSS/infrastructure BSS should be in the receive state in order to
 receive transmissions from the source DMG STA for the duration of the SP. Subclause 9.33.7 describes the
 rules for when the scheduled SP has both the Source and Destination AID fields equal to the broadcast AID.
 Only a STA identified as the source DMG STA or destination DMG STA of an SP shall transmit during the

At the beginning of an SP, except when the source DMG STA intends to establish a DMG Protected Period
in which case the rules described in 9.33.6.6 shall be followed before the source DMG STA initiates the
frame exchange in the SP, a source DMG STA shall transmit a frame to the destination DMG STA using the
DMG Control modulation class before it uses any other modulation class for transmission if the Heartbeat
field in the destination DMG STA’s DMG Capabilities element is 1. The frame sent by the STA may be an
RTS or a DMG CTS-To-Self. The frame sent by the STA may be a SSW frame or a BRP packet if the STA
is performing beamforming (9.7.5a.5).
At the beginning of an SP, a destination DMG STA shall transmit a frame to the source DMG STA using the
DMG Control modulation class before it uses any other modulation for transmission if the Heartbeat field in
the source DMG STA’s DMG Capabilities element is 1 and the frame sent by the destination DMG STA is
the unsolicited DMG DTS as first frame in the SP of the STA performing DMG Protected Period (9.33.6.6).
Any MAC entity coordinated by an MM-SME that belongs to an MMSL cluster identified by the Source
AID and Destination AID that are equal to, respectively, the Source AID and Destination AID of the
Allocation field in the Extended Schedule element that allocates the SP may transmit during the SP, if the
STA sent an MMS element to the peer STA and the BeamLink Cluster field within the MMS element is 1.
The PCP/AP may create SPs in its beacon interval with the source and destination AID subfields within an
Allocation field set to 255 to prevent transmissions during specific periods in the beacon interval.
The PCP/AP shall set the Beamforming Training subfield to one in the Allocation field for an SP within an
Extended Schedule element to indicate that the source DMG STA of this SP initiates beamforming training
with the destination DMG STA at the start of that SP. The source DMG STA and destination DMG STA of
the SP shall perform beamforming training as described in 9.35.
If the PCP Active subfield is 0 in the Allocation field for an SP within an Extended Schedule element,
neither the destination DMG STA of the SP nor the source DMG STA of the SP shall transmit to the PCP
during the SP if none of the STAs are the PCP.
In no case shall the source or destination DMG STA extend a transmission frame exchange sequence that
started during an SP beyond the end of that SP. A STA that initiates a sequence shall check that the frame
exchange sequence, including any control frame responses, completes before the end of the SP.
When scheduling two adjacent SPs, the PCP/AP should allocate the SPs separated by at least
aDMGPPMinListeningTime if one or more of the source or destination DMG STAs participate in both SPs.
Except for frames used for beamforming as described in 9.35, the source of an SP may retransmit a frame
PIFS after the end of the frame transmission in case a response frame is expected from the destination DMG
STA and a SIFS period elapses without receipt of the expected transmission.
The source DMG STA can relinquish the remainder of an SP to the destination DMG STA by sending a
Grant frame to the destination DMG STA (9.33.7.3).
9.33.6.3 Contention-based access period (CBAP) allocation
The PCP/AP shall set the AllocationType subfield to 1, the Source AID subfield to the broadcast AID or to
the AID of the source of the CBAP, and the Destination AID subfield to the broadcast AID or to the AID of
the destination of the CBAP in an Allocation field within an Extended Schedule element to indicate a CBAP
allocation.
All CBAPs are allocated by the PCP/AP, except when allocated by a non-PCP/non-AP STA with the
transmission of a Grant frame following an SP truncation (9.33.8). Multiple CBAPs may be present in a
beacon interval, with the location and duration of each determined by the PCP/AP and announced in the

 Extended Schedule element. When only one CBAP is present and no other allocations exist for the DTI, then
 the PCP/AP shall announce the presence of the CBAP by setting the CBAP Only field to 1 in the DMG
 Parameters field of the DMG Beacon. If at least one non-CBAP allocation is present, or more than one
 CBAP are present, or no allocations are present within a DTI, then the PCP/AP shall set the CBAP Only
 field to 0 in the DMG Parameters field in the DMG Beacon transmitted during the BTI. The PCP/AP shall
 set the CBAP Only field to 0 in the DMG Parameters field within a transmitted DMG Beacon if the DMG
 Beacon contains at least one Extended Schedule element.
 When the entire DTI is allocated to CBAP through the CBAP Only field in the DMG Parameters field, then
 that CBAP is pseudo-static and exists for dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals following the most
 recently transmitted DMG Beacon that contained the indication, except if the CBAP is canceled by the
 transmission by the PCP/AP of a DMG Beacon with the CBAP Only field of the DMG Parameters field
 equal to 0 or an Announce frame with an Extended Schedule element. A guard time (9.33.6.5) precedes a
 CBAP that is allocated through the CBAP Only field equal to 1.
 Channel access during a CBAP shall follow the rules described in 9.33.5.
 9.33.6.4 Pseudo-static allocations
 An SP or CBAP allocation is pseudo-static if the Pseudo-static field in the Allocation control field for the SP
 or CBAP is 1, or when the Extended Schedule element is not used and the CBAP Only field within the DMG
 Parameters field of the DMG Beacon frame is 1 (9.33.6.3). A pseudo-static SP or CBAP recurs at the same
 relative offset to TBTT and with the same duration in up to dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals
 following the last received Extended Schedule element containing the pseudo-static allocation or DMG
 Beacon with the CBAP Only field equal to 1.
 A STA might fail to receive up to dot11MaxLostBeacons minus 1 Extended Schedule elements or DMG
 Beacon with the CBAP Only field equal to 1 in consecutive beacon intervals and still may access the
 channel during the pseudo-static SP or CBAP. The STA shall cease transmission during a pseudo-static
 allocation if it fails to receive an Extended Schedule element or DMG Beacon with the CBAP Only field
 equal to 1 for dot11MaxLostBeacons consecutive beacon intervals.
 The PCP/AP may change the offset relative to TBTT or the duration of a pseudo-static allocation by
 transmitting a modified Allocation field in an Extended Schedule element before dot11MaxLostBeacons
 beacon intervals from the last transmitted Extended Schedule element. The PCP/AP may delete a pseudo-
 static allocation by transmitting an Extended Schedule element that does not include an allocation field
 containing that allocation’s TID, source AID, and destination AID before the completion of
 dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals from the last transmitted Extended Schedule element. In either
 case, the PCP/AP should not schedule a new allocation that overlaps with the previous pseudo-static
 allocation for a minimum of dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals unless both the new and previous
 allocation are for a CBAP or the new allocation identifies the same source DMG STA as the original
 pseudo-static allocation.
 To maintain the same position of the allocation with respect to the start of a beacon interval, the value of the
 Allocation Block Period subfield within an Allocation field of the Extended Schedule element shall be set to
 be an integer multiple or submultiple of the beacon interval duration.
 If the destination DMG STA of a pseudo-static allocation receives an Extended Schedule element with an
 Allocation field that indicates a change in the schedule of the pseudo-static allocation, the STA should enter
 receive state during the new pseudo-static allocation and may enter receive state during the previous
 allocation to account for the time it can take the source DMG STA of the allocation to receive the updated
 schedule.

9.33.6.5 Guard time
Guard time is the time between the end of one allocation and the start of the following allocation, provided
these allocations are not under spatial sharing (10.31). For the purpose of guard time insertion, an allocation
is defined as an SP, a CBAP, and a BTI or A-BFT or ATI that is immediately followed by a CBAP allocated
through the CBAP Only field (9.33.6.3). Guard times are used to keep transmissions in adjacent allocations
from colliding. Figure 9-45 shows an example of the insertion of the guard time such that the allocations are
separated by at least the guard time, in case the STAs participating in the adjacent allocations drift towards
each other’s allocation.
                                                                         Desirable allocation N+1

                                         Figure 9-45—The guard time
The PCP/AP inserts a sufficient guard time between adjacent allocations to insure that transmissions in
adjacent allocations do not overlap in time. For each of the adjacent allocations, guard times are calculated
based on the worst case drift and the maximum allowed number of lost DMG Beacons. The PCP/AP shall
insert a guard time between adjacent allocations that is not shorter than
   GuardTime = ceiling((MLBAllocation_i + 1) × ([ClockAccuracy (ppm) × 10-6] × DriftIntervalAllocation_i) +
   (MLBAllocation_i+1 + 1) × ([ClockAccuracy (ppm) × 10-6] × DriftIntervalAllocation_i+1) + SIFS +
   aAirPropagationTime, aTSFResolution)
where
   The value of MLBAllocation_i (and MLBAllocation_i+1) for each allocation depends on whether the allocation
                              is pseudo-static. MLBAllocation_i (and MLBAllocation_i+1) is 0 for a nonpseudo-
                              static allocation and is equal to dot11MaxLostBeacons if the allocation is
                              pseudo-static.
   ClockAccuracy              is equal to aClockAccuracy.
   DriftIntervalAllocation_i (and DriftIntervalAllocation_i+1) is the time elapsed since a synchronizing reference
                              event and is not greater than the beacon interval. The synchronizing event is the
                              reception of the Timestamp field from the PCP/AP. For a pseudo-static
                              allocation, DriftIntervalAllocation_i (and DriftIntervalAllocation_i+1) is equal to the
                              beacon interval.
   aAirPropagationTime accounts for the propagation delay between the STAs participating in the
                              adjacent allocations.
   aTSFResolution             is the resolution of the TSF timer (10.38).

 9.33.6.6 DMG Protected Period
 9.33.6.6.1 Introduction
 Communicating STA pairs of neighboring PBSS/infrastructure BSS might be granted SPs that potentially
 create interference for neighbor PBSS/infrastructure BSS STA pairs. SPs within a PBSS/infrastructure BSS
 can also experience such interference when spatial diversity conditions change. The intent of DMG
 Protected Period is to minimize such interference by allowing any pair of STAs to protect their SP and
 thereby limit the transmission of frames during the DMG Protected period to not more than one pair of a set
 of potentially interfering pairs of communicating stations.
 A DMG Protected Period can be created by the source DMG STA during an SP, and shall be created by the
 source DMG STA if at least one of the following conditions is met:
    —     The source DMG STA is the PCP/AP of the BSS, the ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield within the
          DMG Parameters field of the last DMG Beacon frame transmitted by the source DMG STA is equal
          to 1, and the Protected Period Enforced field within the ECPAC Policy Detail field of the last
          ECPAC Policy element transmitted by the source DMG STA is equal to 1.
    —     The source DMG STA is not the PCP/AP of the BSS, the ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield within
          the DMG Parameters field of the last DMG Beacon frame received by the source DMG STA from
          the PCP/AP of the BSS is equal to 1, and the Protected Period Enforced field within the ECPAC
          Policy Detail field of the last ECPAC Policy element received by the source DMG STA from the
          PCP/AP of the BSS is equal to 1.
 Both the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA of an SP are owners of the DMG Protected Period.
 During any DMG Protected Period, both stations can receive frames from the other participant.
 A DMG STA that creates a DMG Protected Period during an SP in which it is a source DMG STA or a
 destination DMG STA moves to and stays in Listening Mode during time interval that starts before the start
 of the SP and remains in the Listening mode until it is allowed to use the SP. The actual duration of the time
 the STA stays in the Listening Mode is limited by the aDMGPPMinListeningTime parameter. The intent of
 the Listening Mode is that the DMG STA listens to other DMG STAs that may have an SP that overlaps
 with the SP where the DMG STA is a source DMG STA or a destination DMG STA. The NAV mechanism
 is used to indicate the time occupancy and the DMG STA in the Listening Mode updates NAV timers. If the
 NAV timers are not equal to 0, the DMG STA does not use the time of the SP in which it is a source DMG
 STA or a destination DMG STA. If none of the NAV timers has a nonzero value at the start of the SP, the
 DMG STA is allowed to leave the Listening Mode and use the SP. If at least one of the NAV timers has a
 nonzero value at the start of the SP, the DMG STA is allowed to leave the Listening Mode and to use the
 time remaining in the SP after all NAV timers become or already have value zero.
 Listening Mode is a mode of operation during which a DMG STA is in receiving state and meets at least one
 of the following conditions:
    a)    Its receiving antenna are in the quasi-omni mode.
    b)    Its receiving antenna are directed to the peer DMG STA for which this DMG STA is either the
          destination or source DMG STA.
 A DMG Protected Period is established through an RTS/DMG CTS handshake. To create a DMG Protected
 Period, the source DMG STA of an SP sends an RTS, and the recipient STA responds with a DMG CTS. If
 the recipient STA responds with a DMG CTS, then a DMG Protected Period is established; otherwise, no
 DMG Protected Period has been established. In all cases of DMG Protected Period establishment, the same

antenna configurations that are used by the STAs that establish the DMG Protected Period are used for the
exchange of frames during the DMG Protected Period.
9.33.6.6.2 DMG Protected Period establishment and maintenance
A DMG STA that attempts to create a DMG Protected Period during an SP shall transition to Listening
Mode not less than aDMGPPMinListeningTime before the attempt and shall remain in Listening Mode for
at least aDMGPPMinListeningTime before making the attempt.
A STA shall not issue an RTS to establish a DMG Protected Period if any of its NAV timers is not equal to
zero.
A DMG STA that transmits an RTS to establish a DMG Protected Period during an SP in which it is a source
DMG STA shall not transmit the RTS outside of the SP and the value of the Duration field of the RTS shall
not exceed the duration of the portion of the SP that remains following the RTS transmission.
In order to maintain STAs that are not aware of the establishment of the DMG Protected Period because they
have begun listening to the medium after the establishment of a DMG Protected Period, a STA that
established a DMG Protected period should transmit additional RTSs. An additional RTS should be sent at
the end of every (aDMGPPMinListeningTime – aRTSTimeoutTime) interval during the DMG Protected
Period if the duration of the RTS/DMG CTS exchange is less than the time remaining in the SP.
A DMG STA that transmitted an RTS that established a DMG Protected Period shall transmit data frames
during the DMG Protected Period using the same antenna configuration as was used for the transmission of
the RTS.
A DMG STA should transition to Listening Mode not less than aDMGPPMinListeningTime before the start
of an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA.
During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA
equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP
shall respond with a DMG CTS if the recipient DMG STA has been in Listening Mode for
aDMGPPMinListeningTime at the start of the reception of the RTS and none of its NAV timers has a
nonzero value.
During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA
equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP
shall not respond with a DMG CTS if at the start of the reception of the RTS the recipient DMG STA has a
nonzero value in at least one of its NAV timers or the recipient DMG STA has not been in Listening Mode
for at least aDMGPPMinListeningTime.
During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA
equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP
may respond with a DMG DTS if at the start of the reception of the RTS the recipient DMG STA has a
nonzero value in at least one of its NAV timers.
A DMG STA may transmit a DMG DTS after expiration of the aRTSTimeoutTime time following the start
of an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, if any of its NAV timers has a nonzero value at that time
and no RTS has been received from the source DMG STA of the SP and the DMG STA has been in
Listening Mode for aDMGPPMinListeningTime immediately preceding the start of transmission of the
DMG DTS. The destination DMG STA shall not transmit a DMG DTS if any portion of the DMG DTS
would be transmitted outside of the SP.

 The value in the Duration field of a DMG DTS shall be calculated by subtracting the DMG DTS
 transmission time from the NAV timer in the destination DMG STA that has the largest value at the time of
 the start of the transmission of the DMG DTS. The NAV-DA and NAV-SA fields shall be set to the MAC
 addresses that identify the NAV timer in the destination DMG STA that was used to determine the Duration
 field value of the DMG DTS.
 During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA
 equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP
 may respond with a DMG DTS if at the start of the reception of the RTS the recipient DMG STA has not
 been in Listening Mode for at least aDMGPPMinListeningTime. The value of the Duration field of the
 DMG DTS sent by the recipient DMG STA shall include the difference of aDMGPPMinListeningTime and
 the elapsed time since the recipient DMG STA has been in Listening Mode, and the NAV-SA and the NAV-
 DA fields of the DMG DTS shall contain the recipient DMG STA MAC address.
 A destination DMG STA that responds to an RTS with a DMG CTS or DMG DTS shall transmit the
 response frame a SIFS interval after the end of the received RTS. A destination DMG STA that transmits
 either a DMG CTS or a DMG DTS shall use the same antenna configuration for the subsequent transmission
 of ACK frames and data frames within the SP as is used for the transmission of the DMG CTS or DMG
 DTS.
 The source DMG STA of an SP can send a CF-End to the destination DMG STA of the SP to truncate a
 DMG Protected Period. Regardless of whether this CF-End is sent, a CF-End is also sent to the PCP/AP (see
 9.33.8).
 9.33.6.6.3 NAV Update in DMG Protected Period
 STAs in the Listening Mode shall update their NAV timers according to the procedures described in
 9.33.10.
 NOTE—Support of multiple NAV timers as defined in 9.33.10 is not limited to be used in the Listening Mode only and
 is also used in any case a NAV update is performed.
 When an SP terminates, either through time allocation expiration or truncation, then the source DMG STA
 of that SP may reset any NAV timer to 0 that has an associated variable NAV_DTSCANCELABLE with a
 value of true.
 9.33.6.6.4 Interference report
 A STA that receives an RTS and/or DMG CTS frame that updates the NAV and that overlaps in time with
 an SP where the STA is destination or source, may report the overlap to the PCP/AP by sending a DMG
 ADDTS Request frame variant (8.5.3.3.2) and including in the DMG TSPEC element (8.4.2.136) the
 indication of interference in the TSCONST field (Figure 8-401ag). Transmission of the DMG ADDTS
 Request frame variant shall follow the rules defined in 10.4, with the following exceptions.
 The Allocation ID field of the DMG TSPEC element shall identify the allocation during which the
 interference was detected. One ADDTS Request frame is generated and transmitted for each allocation
 during which interference is detected.
 The TSCONST field of the DMG TSPEC element may contain one or more Traffic Scheduling Constraint
 fields. Each Traffic Scheduling Constraint field provides information separately for each overlapping NAV
 event. The following NAV events should be reported:
    a)     Nonzero NAV at start of SP
    b)     Extension of NAV during the SP, including extension of an initial nonzero NAV and transitioning of
           the NAV from zero to nonzero value during the SP

   c)    Truncation of the NAV during the SP
The TSCONST Start Time field is set to the TSF value at which the NAV event is detected. For event a)
above, the TSCONST Start Time field shall be set to the start of the SP. For event b) above, the TSCONST
Start Time field shall be set to the time the NAV timer was updated or initialized to the value reported in the
TSCONST Duration field. For event c) above, the TSCONST Start Time field shall be set to the time the
NAV timer was reset.
The TSCONST Duration field shall be set to the NAV timer value at the TSCONST Start Time, which is the
value zero for event c).
The TSCONST Period shall be set to 0 indicating that the field is not applicable.
The Interferer MAC Address shall be set to the NAVDST of the NAV timer from which the TSCONST Start
Time was derived (9.33.10).
All values conveyed in the TSCONST field shall refer to the allocation identified by the value of the
Allocation ID field of the TSPEC.
The value of other fields within the DMG TSPEC element shall conform to the rules specified in 10.4.
Use of the information conveyed in the TSCONST field is outside the scope of this standard.
9.33.6.7 Service period recovery
When a non-PCP/non-AP STA fails to receive the Extended Schedule element for a beacon interval, the
non-PCP/non-AP STA has no knowledge of the nonpseudo-static SPs allocated during the beacon interval
that indicate it is the source DMG STA; therefore, it fails to initiate transmission during those SPs. If the
destination of the nonpseudo-static SP is a PCP/AP and it does not receive any frames from the source non-
PCP/non-AP STA for the dot11SPIdleTimeout interval from the start of the SP, the PCP/AP may truncate
the SP and use the mechanism described in 9.33.7 to reallocate the remaining duration of the SP to the
source DMG STA of the SP or other STAs provided that it was a truncatable SP. If the SP is not a
truncatable SP, the PCP may stay awake or may switch to Doze state. If the non-PCP/non-AP STA failed to
receive the Extended Schedule element from the PCP/AP for that beacon interval, it may switch to Doze
state or may direct its receive antenna towards the PCP/AP to receive a Grant during nonpseudo-static SPs
or CBAPs in the current beacon interval.
A PCP/AP may reclaim the entire time allocated in an SP between two non-PCP/non-AP STAs if the
following two conditions are met:
   —     The SP is announced within an Extended Schedule element transmitted during the ATI.
   —     The PCP/AP does not receive a response frame from at least one of the source and destination non-
         PCP/non-AP STAs of that SP as part of the ATI exchange (9.33.3).
In either case described in this subclause, the PCP/AP may reallocate the reclaimed SP time as a CBAP, SP,
or take no further action. Otherwise, if none of these conditions apply, no time may be reclaimed.
9.33.7 Dynamic allocation of service period
9.33.7.1 General
Dynamic allocation of service period is employed to allocate channel time during scheduled SPs and
CBAPs. The procedure includes an optional Polling Period (PP) phase and a Grant Period (GP) phase.
Service periods allocated using this mechanism do not persist beyond a beacon interval. Persistent

 allocations are created using the allocation mechanisms described in 10.4.
 The PP Available field in the STA Availability element (8.4.2.135) indicates whether a STA participates in
 the PP phase of the Dynamic Allocation of Service Period mechanism. A STA that participates in PP phase
 of the Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods responds to Poll frames during the PP. A STA that participates
 in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods uses the time allocated through Grant frames during the GP to
 transmit frames. A STA may set the PP Available field in a transmitted STA Availability element to zero to
 indicate that the STA does not respond to Poll frames during the PP and the GP.
 NOTE—A STA can receive a Grant frame in periods of the beacon interval other than the GP, in which case the STA
 uses the time allocated through the Grant frame. An example is described in 9.35.5.
 The PCP/AP shall not transmit Poll frames to a STA whose PP Available field in the STA Availability
 element is 0. The PCP/AP shall not dynamically allocate a service period to a STA that is in a Doze BI
 (10.2.5). A PCP/AP may transmit Poll frames to a STA from which the PCP/AP has not received a STA
 Availability element with the PP Available field from the STA equal to 0.
 If a PCP/AP wants to dynamically allocate Service Periods during a scheduled SP for which both the source
 and destination AID fields are set to the broadcast AID, the PCP/AP shall set the truncatable subfield to one
 within the Allocation field corresponding to the scheduled SP.
 If a non-PCP/non-AP STA is neither source nor an individually addressed destination during a truncatable
 SP and the non-PCP/non-AP STA participates in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods and the non-PCP/
 non-AP STA is in an Awake BI, then the non-PCP/non-AP STA should be in the Awake state for the
 duration of the truncatable SP.
 A non-PCP/non-AP STA that participates in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods shall be in the Awake
 state for dot11MinPPDuration from the start of each truncatable SP for which both the source and the
 destination AID fields are set to the broadcast AID and that occurs within each Awake BI of that STA.
 Following the expiration of dot11MinPPDuration, the non-PCP/non-AP STA should remain in the Awake
 state until the end of the truncatable SP.
 A STA shall be in the Awake state for dot11MinPPDuration from the start of each scheduled CBAP that
 occurs within each Awake BI of that STA. A STA that enters the Doze state at any time during a CBAP and
 then returns to the Awake state later during that same CBAP shall not transmit except in response to a
 reception or when an explicit Grant frame is received that gives the STA permission to transmit during the
 CBAP.
 As described in 9.33.8, a STA that participates in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods and that is neither
 source nor destination during a truncatable SP can be in the receive state with its receive antennas
 configured in a quasi-omni antenna pattern for the duration of the truncatable SP.
 A STA that receives a Grant frame with an SP allocation for which it is either source or destination shall not
 transmit longer than the time granted to it.
 Any STA coordinated by an MM-SME that belongs to an MMSL cluster identified by the Source AID and
 Destination AID that are equal to, respectively, the Source AID and Destination AID of the Dynamic
 Allocation Info field in the Grant frame may transmit during the allocation, if the STA sent an MMS element
 to the peer STA and the BeamLink Cluster field within the MMS element is 1.
 An example of dynamic allocation of service period is shown in Figure 9-46.

9.33.7.2 Polling period (PP)
A PCP/AP that uses a PP to dynamically allocate an SP within the DTI shall commence the PP at a time
instant indicated by at least one of the following:
   —     Anytime during a scheduled SP for which the source AID and destination AID are equal to the
         broadcast AID, excluding any time that has been allocated dynamically
   —     Anytime during a TXOP within a scheduled CBAP for which the destination AID is equal to the
         broadcast AID, excluding any time that has been allocated dynamically
   —     Anytime during the relinquished channel time following an SP truncation, excluding any time that
         has been allocated dynamically
The PCP/AP shall not transmit a frame during a PP if any portion of that frame would extend beyond the end
of the originally scheduled SP or CBAP.
During the PP, the PCP/AP may transmit individually addressed Poll frames to STAs to solicit SPR frames
from those STAs. The Duration field within each Poll frame i out of a total of n (0 < i <= n) transmitted Poll
frames in the PP shall be calculated as follows:
   Durationi = Duration_of_Poll_transmissioni,n + Offset_of_SPR_transmissionm +
   ceiling(TXTIME(SPRm), aTSFResolution)
The PCP/AP expects an SPR frame in response to each transmitted Poll frame (i.e., m=n). The position of
each SPR frame in the sequence of SPR frames is indicated as j. Thus, j=1 refers to the first SPR frame
transmission in the sequence of SPR frames, and j=m refers to the last SPR frame transmission in the
sequence of SPR frames. Based on this, the Response Offset field within each Poll frame i transmitted in the
PP shall be calculated as follows:
   Response Offseti = Duration_of_Poll_transmissioni,n + Offset_of_SPR_transmissionj
where

    Offset_of_SPR_transmissionj is defined as
          —    For j=1, Offset_of_SPR_transmission1= Poll_SPR_space
          —    For 2 < j <=m, Offset_of_SPR_transmissionj =                     Offset_of_SPR_transmissionj-1+
               floor(TXTIME(SPRj) + SIFS, aTSFResolution)+1
    AntennaSwitchingTimei is equal to 0 if the PCP/AP uses the same antenna to transmit frame i and frame
                             i+1 and is equal to dot11AntennaSwitchingTime otherwise.
    Poll_SPR_space is the time interval between the end of the last Poll frame transmitted by the PCP/AP and
                             the expected start time of the first SPR frame by the non-PCP/non-AP STA, and
                             is defined as Poll_SPR_space = SIFS.
 NOTE—This        Offset_of_SPR_transmission    calculation   guarantees   that    no   less   than      SIFS     or
 SIFS+dot11AntennaSwitchingTime is provided for the PCP/AP to switch antennas when receiving an SPR from
 different STAs.
 A STA that receives an individually addressed Poll frame shall respond to the PCP/AP with a single
 directional and individually addressed SPR frame at the time offset from the end of the Poll frame indicated
 in the Response Offset field within the received Poll frame. The Duration field within the SPR frame shall
 be set to the value of the Duration field contained in the received Poll frame, minus the value of the
 Response Offset field contained in the received Poll frame, minus the time taken to transmit the SPR frame.
 The PP ends at a time equal to the end of the last Poll frame transmission plus the value of the Response
 Offset field in that Poll frame plus the expected duration of the SPR transmission that is expected in
 response to that Poll frame plus SIFS.
 9.33.7.3 Grant period (GP)
 A PCP/AP that intends to dynamically allocate an SP within the DTI shall commence a GP at a time instant
 indicated by at least one of the following:
    —     SIFS interval following the end of a PP if the PP is present
    —     Anytime during a scheduled SP for which the source AID and destination AID are equal to the
          broadcast AID if a PP does not precede the GP, excluding any time that has been allocated
          dynamically
    —     Anytime during a TXOP within a scheduled CBAP for which the destination AID is equal to the
          broadcast AID, excluding any time that has been allocated dynamically
    —     Anytime during the relinquished channel time following an SP truncation if a PP does not precede
          the GP, excluding any time that has been allocated dynamically
 The PCP/AP shall not transmit a frame during a GP if any portion of that frame would extend beyond the
 end of the originally scheduled SP or CBAP, or beyond the end of an immediately following SP if that SP
 has the broadcast AID as both source and destination AID, whichever is later.
 A non-PCP/non-AP STA may switch to Doze state if it does not receive a Grant frame from the PCP/AP
 within dot11MinPPDuration from the start of the scheduled SP for which the source AID and destination
 AID are set to the broadcast AID.

                                                                                                               IEEE

To commence the GP, the PCP/AP shall transmit Grant frames to notify the source DMG STA and
destination DMG STA about a dynamically allocated service period. The PCP/AP should transmit the last
Grant frame within a GP to the source of the dynamically allocated SP if the source of the dynamically
allocated SP is not the PCP/AP. In each transmitted Grant frame, the PCP/AP shall set the Duration field
within the Grant frame to a time that does not overlap in time with another SP that has either the source AID
or destination AID different from the broadcast AID. In addition, the source AID and destination AID fields
shall be set to the source and destination, respectively, of the dynamically allocated SP, the AllocationType
field set to indicate the channel access mechanism during the allocation, and the Allocation Duration field
set to a value that is not greater than the result of the subtraction of the duration of all remaining Grant frame
transmissions, if any, plus all appropriate IFSs (9.3.2.3), plus 2×SIFS from the value of the Duration field.
An allocation that is indicated in this manner begins at the time that is equal to the PHY-TXEND.indication
of the Grant frame plus the value from the Duration field of the Grant frame minus the value of the
Allocation Duration field of the Grant frame, and continues for the time indicated in the Allocation Duration
field of the Grant frame.
The Dynamic Allocation Info field within Grant frames transmitted as part of the same GP shall be the same.
NOTE—This means the PCP/AP can create only one allocation per GP.
During an SP between a source DMG STA and a destination DMG STA, the source DMG STA may
transmit a Grant frame to the destination DMG STA to relinquish the remainder of the SP to the destination
DMG STA. In the Allocation Info field of the transmitted Grant frame, the source DMG STA shall set
source AID field to the AID of the destination DMG STA, the destination AID field to the AID of the source
DMG STA, the AllocationType field set to indicate SP, and the Allocation Duration field set to the time
remaining in the SP minus the time taken to transmit the Grant frame. The Duration field in the Grant frame
shall be set to the value of the Allocation Duration field. Upon transmission of the Grant frame, for the
remainder the SP the roles of source DMG STA and destination DMG STA are swapped between the STAs.
During a TXOP between a TXOP holder and a TXOP responder, the TXOP holder may transmit a Grant
frame to the TXOP responder to relinquish the remainder of the TXOP to the TXOP responder. In the
transmitted Grant frame, the TXOP holder shall set source AID field to the AID of the TXOP responder, the
destination AID field to the AID of the TXOP holder, the AllocationType field set to indicate CBAP, and the
Allocation Duration field set to the time remaining in the TXOP minus the time taken to transmit the Grant
frame. The Duration field in the Grant frame shall be set to the value of the Allocation Duration field. Upon
transmission of the Grant frame, for the remainder the TXOP the roles of TXOP holder and TXOP
responder are swapped between the STAs.
A STA that receives a Grant frame shall not update its NAV if the value of either the source AID or
destination AID fields in the Grant frame are equal to the STA’s AID.
The PCP/AP may grant a dynamic allocation of service period to a STA that does not transmit a SPR frame
during the PP.
9.33.8 Dynamic truncation of service period
A STA truncates an SP to release the remaining time in the SP. The STA can use the CF-End frame to
truncate the SP at the peer STA, to reset NAV in third party STAs and to return to the PCP/AP the time left
in the SP, thus allowing the PCP/AP to grant any portion of the released time as part of an SP to any other
STA or to allocate any portion of it as a CBAP. The STA can use the Grant frame to release any part of the
time left in the SP as a CBAP.
If a STA is neither source nor destination during a truncatable SP and the STA desires to participate in
Dynamic allocation of service period, the STA should be in the receive state with its receive antenna
configured in a quasi-omni antenna pattern for the duration of the truncatable SP. If both the source and

Std 802.11ad-2012                               LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 destination AID fields of a truncatable SP are set to the broadcast AID, a non-PCP/non-AP STA may direct
 its receive antenna to its PCP/AP for the duration of the truncatable SP if the non-PCP/non-AP STA does not
 participate in a frame exchange and the truncatable SP is not dynamically allocated to the non-PCP/non-AP
 STA.
 Only the source DMG STA of an SP may truncate the SP, except that the destination DMG STA may
 truncate the SP if it does not receive an expected transmission from the source DMG STA at the start of the
 SP as defined in 9.33.6.7.
 In order to advertise the availability of truncatable SP time for reuse through PCP/AP dynamic allocation, a
 non-PCP/non-AP STA shall transmit an CF-End frame to the PCP/AP. A STA is not required to truncate an
 SP if a portion of the SP is unused.
 In order to enable CBAP access during the time released through SP truncation, the STA shall broadcast a
 Grant frame with the Source AID and Destination AID set to broadcast AID, the AllocationType field set to
 indicate CBAP and the Duration field set to the time needed to transmit the Grant frame(s) (the Duration
 field in a Grant frame does not include duration of that frame) plus SIFS and plus the time needed to transmit
 the following CF-End frame and the response CF-End frame, if required and appropriate IFS (9.3.2.3)
 values. The Allocation Duration field shall be set to a value that is not greater than the result of the
 subtraction of the value in the Duration field from the time remaining in the SP. The CBAP that is indicated
 in this manner begins at the time that is equal to the PHY-TXEND.indication of the Grant frame plus the
 value from the Duration field of the Grant frame and continues for the time indicated in the Allocation
 Duration field of the Grant frame.
 The STA shall not transmit the Grant frame and shall not transmit the CF-End frame to the PCP/AP if the SP
 is not indicated as truncatable.
 After transmission of the CF-End frame to the PCP/AP or after broadcasting a Grant frame, the STA shall
 transmit a CF-End frame to the peer STA of the SP. The CF-End frame releases any time remaining in the
 SP at the recipient and resets the NAV in third party STAs. The NAV is reset only if the RA and TA of the
 CF-End frame match the addresses of the frame that established the NAV (see 9.33.10). The recipient STA
 may transmit a CF-End frame SIFS after the reception if the Duration field of the received frame is not equal
 to 0 and the transmission does not extend beyond the end of the originally scheduled SP.
 A STA shall not initiate SP truncation if there is not enough time left in the SP to complete the frame
 exchange required for truncation of the SP.
 After the truncation is completed, the PCP/AP may dynamically allocate any portion of the relinquished
 channel time that has not been allocated to a CBAP through a transmitted Grant frame (9.33.7).
 9.33.9 Dynamic extension of service period
 A non-PCP/non-AP STA uses dynamic extension of SP to extend the allocated time in the current SP. The
 additional time can be used to support variable bit rate traffic, for retransmissions or for other purposes. The
 SPR frame is sent by a non-PCP/non-AP STA to the PCP/AP to request additional SP time in the current
 beacon interval.
 Except in response to a Poll frame from the PCP/AP, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not transmit an SPR
 frame within an SP if the current SP is not extendable (see 8.4.2.134).
 Only the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA of an SP can transmit an SPR during that SP.
 If the PCP/AP is not the source of an extendable SP, it should be in the receive state and with its receive
 antennas configured in a quasi-omni antenna pattern for the duration of the extendable SP.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                      Std 802.11ad-2012
To request extension of the current SP, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall transmit an SPR frame to the PCP/AP.
The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not request extension of the current SP if there is not enough time left in the
SP to complete the frame exchange required for the SP extension. In the transmitted SPR frame, the STA
shall set the RA field to the address of the PCP/AP, the Duration field to the time left in the SP (not
including the SPR transmission time), and the Allocation Duration field to the additional amount of time
requested by the STA following the end of the current SP.
The PCP/AP may grant the request for an extension of an SP only if the following SP has the broadcast AID
as both source and destination AID, and the duration of the following SP is larger than the value of the
Allocation Duration field in the received SPR frame. To grant an extension request, the PCP/AP shall
transmit a Grant frame with the RA field set to the value of the TA in the received SPR frame, the Duration
field set to the value of the Duration field received in the SPR frame minus SIFS and minus the duration of
this Grant frame transmission, and the Allocation Duration field set to the amount of additional time granted
by the PCP/AP.
To decline a request for an extension of an SP, the PCP/AP shall transmit a Grant frame with the RA field
set to the value of the TA in the received SPR frame, the Duration field set to the value of the Duration field
received in the SPR frame minus SIFS and minus the duration of this Grant frame transmission, and the
Allocation Duration field set to 0.
The extension request is successful if the non-PCP/non-AP STA receives from the PCP/AP a Grant frame
with a nonzero value for the Allocation Duration field SIFS after the SPR. SIFS after the reception of a
Grant frame from the PCP/AP with a nonzero value for the Allocation Duration field, the non-PCP/non-AP
STA shall transmit a Grant frame to the partner STA of the SP with the Duration field set to the value of the
Duration field of the Grant frame received from the PCP/AP minus the duration of this Grant frame
transmission minus SIFS, and the Allocation Duration field set to the value of the Allocation Duration field
of the Grant frame received from the PCP/AP.
The PCP/AP shall not transmit an SPR frame if it wants to extend an SP in which it is the source. A PCP/AP
that extends an SP for which it is the source DMG STA shall transmit a Grant frame to the destination DMG
STA of the SP to indicate the extension of the SP. The Duration field in the transmitted Grant frame shall be
set to the remaining time in the SP plus any additional channel time allocated by the PCP/AP following the
end of the SP. The Allocation Duration field of the Grant frame shall be set to the additional channel time
allocated by the PCP/AP following the end of the SP.
9.33.10 Updating multiple NAV timers
If a DMG STA supports multiple NAV timers, the number of available NAV timers within the DMG STA
shall be not less than aMinNAVTimersNumber. Each NAV timer is identified by a pair of MAC addresses,
NAVSRC and NAVDST, and has associated variables NAV_RTSCANCELABLE and
NAV_DTSCANCELABLE. Each STA also maintains a variable UPDATE_OPTIONAL. When a STA is
enabled for operation, all NAV timers shall have NULL values for their NAVSRC and NAVDST identifiers,
the value of NAV_RTSCANCELABLE shall be false, the value of NAV_DTSCANCELABLE shall be
false, and each NAV timer shall have the value 0. NAV timer address pairs correspond to the NAV-SA and
NAV-DA fields in DMG DTS frames and correspond to the RA and TA fields of all other received frames
that are used to update the NAV timers. Receipt of any frame can cause an update to the NAV timer whose
identifying address pair corresponds to the specified address fields of the received frame according to the
rules in this subclause.
STAs receiving any valid frame shall perform the following NAV Timer update operation expressed using
the following pseudocode:

END OF NAV_TIMER_UPDATE
During a time period beginning with the completion of each NAV Timer update operation as a result of an
RTS reception and lasting for TXTIME(DMG CTS) +2×SIFS, each STA that desires to reset its NAV shall
monitor the channel to determine if a preamble or carrier detect event has occurred. If such an event has not
occurred during this time period, then the STA may reset to 0 any NAV Timer that has a value of true for its
associated NAV_RTSCANCELABLE variable.
Subsequent to the NAV Timer update operation, each NAV timer counts down until it reaches the value zero
or until it reaches zero through a reset operation.
If a STA receives a valid CF-End response with RA and TA values that match the NAVSRC and NAVDST
values, in any order, for any NAV Timer, then the STA shall set the associated NAV Timer to the value of
the Duration field in the received CF-End frame. If one of NAVSRC or NAVDST of a NAV timer is 0 and
the corresponding NAVDST or NAVSRC, respectively, of the NAV timer match the RA or the TA value of
the received valid CF-End frame, then the STA shall set the associated NAV Timer to the value of the
Duration field in the received CF-End frame.
If one of NAVSRC or NAVDST of a NAV timer is 0 and the nonzero NAVDST or NAVSRC of the NAV
timer match either the RA or the TA value of a received valid frame, the NAVSRC or NAVDST that is 0
shall be set to the RA or TA that does not match the nonzero NAVSRC or NAVDST.

 9.34 DMG PCP/AP clustering
 9.34.1 General
 A PCP/AP may use the PCP/AP clustering mechanism to improve spatial sharing and interference
 mitigation with other co-channel DMG BSSs. There are two types of clustering:
    —     Decentralized PCP/AP clustering that involves a single S-PCP/S-AP in the BSA of the S-PCP/S-AP
    —     Centralized PCP/AP clustering where there can be multiple S-APs in the BSA of any one S-AP, and
          all S-APs are coordinated via a single centralized coordination service set
 PCP/AP clustering allows a PCP/AP that is a member of a cluster to schedule transmissions in
 nonoverlapping time periods with respect to other members of the same cluster since the PCP/AP can
 receive DMG Beacon and Announce frames containing the Extended Schedule element of other PCPs/APs
 that are members of the cluster and can also receive the Extended Schedule element from another BSS
 through associated non-PCP/non-AP STAs (9.34.4).
 A STA is decentralized PCP/AP clustering capable if it sets the Decentralized PCP/AP Clustering field to 1
 within the DMG PCP/AP Capability Information field in the DMG Capabilities element. A STA is
 centralized PCP/AP clustering capable if it sets the Centralized PCP/AP Clustering field to 1 within the
 DMG PCP/AP Capability Information field in the DMG Capabilities element. The PCP/AP employs the
 Clustering Control field and ECPAC Policy Enforced field defined in 8.3.4.1 to configure the use of PCP/
 AP Clustering. A decentralized PCP/AP clustering capable or centralized PCP/AP clustering capable PCP/
 AP that transmits the Clustering Control field is decentralized clustering enabled or centralized clustering
 enabled, respectively. A PCP/AP that does not transmit the Clustering Control field is clustering disabled.
 Decentralized clustering enabled PCPs/APs operating on the same channel may form a decentralized PCP/
 AP cluster. A PCP/AP cluster includes one S-PCP/S-AP and zero or more member PCPs/APs. The MAC
 address of the S-PCP/S-AP shall be the Cluster ID of the decentralized PCP/AP cluster. Centralized
 clustering enabled PCPs/APs operating on the same channel as a S-AP form a centralized PCP/AP cluster as
 described in 9.34.2.2. The Cluster ID of the centralized PCP/AP cluster shall be set to the MAC address of
 the S-AP.
 A clustering enabled PCP/AP that is not a member of any cluster shall set the Cluster Member Role subfield
 to zero in transmitted frames that contain the Clustering Control field.
 Each PCP/AP that is a member of a PCP/AP cluster shall include the Clustering Control field in each DMG
 Beacon it transmits.
 For each cluster, there exists a set of ClusterMaxMem Beacon SPs. The nth Beacon SP, Beacon SPn, begins
 at ClusterTimeOffsetn-1 μs following the TBTT of the S-PCP/S-AP, where
    ClusterTimeOffsetn-1 = 1024 × (dot11BeaconPeriod/ClusterMaxMem) × (n–1)
    and n=2, 3,..., ClusterMaxMem
 The ClusterTimeOffsetn-1 and Beacon SPn where n equals one is reserved for the S-PCP/S-AP.
 A PCP/AP that is a member of a PCP/AP cluster shall transmit its DMG Beacon frame during one of the
 Beacon SPs as specified in 9.34.2.
 The maximum size of the Beacon SP Duration field transmitted by a S-PCP/S-AP shall be the beacon
 interval of the S-PCP/S-AP divided by ClusterMaxMem.

9.34.2 Cluster formation
9.34.2.1 Decentralized PCP/AP cluster formation
A clustering enabled PCP/AP starts a decentralized PCP/AP cluster by becoming an S-PCP/S-AP, subject to
the absence of existing clusters as described below and in 9.34.2.2. A decentralized clustering enabled PCP/
AP becomes an S-PCP/S-AP of a decentralized PCP/AP cluster by transmitting a DMG Beacon at least once
every aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield in the DMG
Parameters field set to 0 and that includes a Clustering Control field with the Beacon SP duration subfield
set to the value of dot11BeaconSPDuration, the Cluster ID subfield set to the S-PCP/S-AP MAC address,
and the Cluster Member Role subfield set to the value for an S-PCP/S-AP. The value of ClusterMaxMem
subfield shall be chosen to keep the result of (beacon interval length/ClusterMaxMem) as an integer number
of microseconds.
A decentralized clustering enabled PCP/AP that receives a DMG Beacon frame with the ECPAC Policy
Enforced subfield in the DMG Parameters field set to 0 from an S-PCP/S-AP on the channel the PCP/AP
selects to establish a BSS shall monitor the channel for DMG Beacon transmissions during each Beacon SP
for an interval of length at least aMinChannelTime. Beacon SPn is empty if no DMG Beacon frame is
received during Beacon SPn over an interval of length aMinChannelTime. The PCP/AP shall not become a
member of the cluster if no Beacon SP is determined to be empty during aMinChannelTime, in which case,
subject to the requirements described in 9.34.2.2, then the PCP/AP may become the S-PCP/S-AP of a new
cluster, or may cease its activity on this channel and, if desired, attempt operation on a different channel.
A decentralized clustering enabled PCP/AP that operates its BSS on a channel on which it discovered an S-
PCP/S-AP within a decentralized PCP/AP cluster and at least one empty Beacon SP shall transmit its DMG
Beacon during an empty Beacon SP. By transmitting its DMG Beacon during an empty Beacon SP and by
setting the clustering control field appropriately as described in 8.3.4.1, the PCP/AP becomes a member
PCP/AP.
The member PCP/AP shall select a beacon interval length that is equal to the beacon interval length of its S-
PCP/S-AP.
The member PCP/AP shall transmit its DMG Beacon with the ECPAC Policy Enforced field set to 0, the
Beacon SP duration subfield set to the value of the Beacon SP duration subfield contained in the S-PCP/S-
AP DMG Beacon, the Cluster ID subfield set to the MAC address of the S-PCP/S-AP, the Cluster Member
Role subfield set to the member PCP/AP value, and the ClusterMaxMem subfield set to the value of the
ClusterMaxMem field contained in the S-PCP/S-AP DMG Beacon.
A PCP/AP with a value of Cluster Member Role that is not zero shall schedule a Beacon SP that is allocated
for DMG Beacon transmission of other cluster member PCPs/APs within the decentralized PCP/AP cluster
at each of ClusterTimeOffsetn, at any time the PCP/AP transmits its own DMG Beacon. The minimum size
of the Beacon SP should be equal to the value of the Beacon SP duration subfield within the S-PCP/S-AP
DMG Beacon.
An S-PCP/S-AP and a member PCP/AP of a decentralized PCP/AP cluster should not transmit or schedule
transmissions during a Beacon SP that is not its own Beacon SP.
Figure 9-47 illustrates, for three PCPs/APs, the Beacon SPs of the S-PCP/S-AP and member PCPs/APs of a
decentralized PCP/AP cluster.

 9.34.2.2 Centralized PCP/AP cluster formation
 In order to become an S-AP, a centralized clustering enabled STA that is stationary with respect to its local
 environment shall successfully perform both the following steps in order:
    —     Configuration step
    —     Verification step
 Once these steps have been performed successfully, the STA has become an S-AP.
    —     Configuration step: The configuration step is defined to be successful if the following occur:
          —       The STA obtains the MAC address of the CCSR; and
          —       The STA obtains an ECPAC Policy Detail field, beacon interval, ClusterMaxMem, Beacon SP
                  duration, TXSS CBAP Offset, TXSS CBAP Duration, TXSS CBAP MaxMem, TSF
                  synchronization parameters, Cluster Time Offset availability information, and a nonempty list
                  of excluded channels for the intended operating class of the STA from the CCSR; and
          —       Either the Channel Starting Frequency of the intended operating class of the STA is defined in
                  Annex E to be 56.16 GHz and channel 2 is an allowed channel in the current regulatory domain
                  and the list of excluded channels includes channel 2, or the Channel Starting Frequency of the
                  intended operating class of the STA is defined in Annex E to be 56.16 GHz and channel 2 is not
                  an allowed channel in the current regulatory domain; and
          —       The beacon interval/ClusterMaxMem is an integer number of microseconds; and
          —       At least one of beacon interval/TXSS CBAP MaxMem or TXSS CBAP MaxMem/beacon
                  interval is an integer.
          Otherwise, the configuration step is defined to be unsuccessful. If the configuration step is
          unsuccessful, then the STA can attempt to resolve the problem or quit attempting to start a
          centralized PCP/AP cluster. The method by which the STA obtains the configuration information
          from the CCSR is not defined in this standard.
    —     Verification step: The verification step is defined to be the following procedure:
          —       The centralized clustering enabled STA monitors the channel for DMG Beacon frames over an
                  interval of at least aMinChannelTime.
          —       During this monitoring period, for each distinct Cluster ID received in a DMG Beacon frame
                  that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced field set to 1 in the DMG Parameters field and Cluster
                  Member Role set to 1 (S-PCP/S-AP of the cluster) or 2 (a member PCP/AP of the cluster), the
                  centralized clustering enabled STA determines if an S-AP with a MAC address equal to the
                  Cluster ID belongs to the same CCSS as the centralized clustering enabled STA, via i)

              determined in this way to belong to the same CCSS as the centralized clustering enabled STA

         The verification step is defined to be unsuccessful if, at the end of the monitoring period, there are
         one or more received DMG Beacon frames that are from another ECPAC. Otherwise, the
         verification step is defined to be successful.
If at least one DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced field set to 1 and was sent by an S-
AP/member PCP/member AP from another ECPAC is received during the monitoring period, the
centralized clustering enabled STA
   —     Shall cease its activity on this channel and, if desired, attempt operation on a different channel, or
   —     If one of the received DMG Beacon frames was sent by an S-AP, may elect to unenroll from its
         current CCSS and join the cluster of the S-AP as a member PCP/AP.
If at least one DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced field set to 1 and was sent by an S-
AP from the same CCSS is received during the monitoring period, the centralized clustering enabled STA
may elect either to unenroll from its current CCSS and join the cluster of the S-AP as a member PCP/AP or
to continue and become an S-AP in the CCSS.
In order to become an S-AP in a centralized PCP/AP cluster, a centralized clustering enabled STA shall take
the following actions:
   —     Set dot11MgmtOptionChannelUsageImplemented to true
   —     Start a BSS as an AP
         —    On a channel that is not listed as excluded by the CCSR, and
         —    At the start time and with the beacon interval configured by the CCSR
   —     Include in transmitted DMG Beacon frames
         —    The ECPAC Policy Enforced field set to 1 in the DMG Parameters field, and
         —    A Clustering Control field with the ClusterMaxMem subfield set to the values configured by
              the CCSR, the Beacon SP Duration subfield set to the value most recently configured by the
              CCSR, the Cluster ID subfield set to the S-AP MAC address, and the Cluster Member Role
              subfield set to 1 (S-PCP/S-AP of the cluster).
An S-AP in a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall set the ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield in the DMG
Parameters field to 1 for the lifetime of the BSS.
An S-AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall include the ECPAC Policy element in (Re)Association
Response, Announce, and Information Response frames with the ECPAC Policy Detail, TXSS CBAP

for the S-AP, the TXSS CBAP MaxMem subfield set to the policy configured by the CCSR, the CCSR ID
subfield set to the MAC address of the CCSR, and bits in the Available Cluster Time Offset Bitmap subfield
set to 0 to indicate the Cluster Time Offsets that are determined to be already in use, excluding the recipient
if sent within an individually addressed frame. The means by which a Cluster Time Offset is determined to
be in use are unspecified. Bits in the Available Cluster Time Offset Bitmap subfield for other Cluster Time
Offsets shall be set to 1.

 least one DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield in the DMG Parameters field set
 to 1 sent by an S-AP on every channel supported by the PCP/AP in the Operating Class within the next

 length, then the PCP/AP shall either join the cluster of the S-AP as a member PCP/AP if centralized PCP/AP
 clustering enabled or cease its activity on this channel and, if desired, attempt operation on a different
 channel.
 A PCP/AP that receives at least one DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield in
 the DMG Parameters field set to 1 sent by an S-AP on every channel supported by the PCP/AP in the
 Operating Class within the most recent aMinChannelTime may ignore DMG Beacon frames that have the
 ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield in the DMG Parameters field set to 1 sent by an S-AP for
 300×aMinChannelTime.
 NOTE—A PCP/AP within a decentralized PCP/AP cluster does not cease DMG Beacon transmission when quitting a
 decentralized PCP/AP cluster. Hence, data communication is unaffected while performing these procedures.
 A centralized clustering enabled PCP/AP that attempts to join the centralized PCP/AP cluster of an S-AP as
 a member PCP/AP shall be a STA coordinated by an MM-SME that also coordinates a second non-PCP/
 non-AP STA, and shall successfully perform the following steps in order:
    —     The PCP/AP shall monitor the channel for DMG Beacon frames during each Beacon SP over an
          interval of length at least aMinChannelTime. A Beacon SPn is empty if no DMG Beacon frame is
          received during the Beacon SPn over an interval of length aMinChannelTime.
    —     The second non-PCP/non-AP STA shall attempt to associate with the S-AP and thereby receive an
          Announce frame from the S-AP. The contents of the Announce frame are passed to the PCP/AP.
    —     Upon receiving an Announce frame that includes the ECPAC Policy element, the PCP/AP shall
          select a Cluster Time Offset index from the intersection of a) the Cluster Time Offset indices of the
          empty Beacon SPs with b) the indices indicated by the Available Cluster Offset Bitmap field in the
          ECPAC Policy element. If the intersection is empty, the PCP/AP shall select a Cluster Time Offset
          index of an empty Beacon SP. The selected Cluster Time Offset index is passed to the second non-
          PCP/non-AP STA.
    —     The second non-PCP/non-AP STA shall respond to the Announce frame with an Information
          Response frame that includes the Cluster Time Offset element containing the Cluster Time Offset
          Index set to the selected index.
    —     The PCP/AP shall operate its BSS at the selected Cluster Time Offset on the channel of the S-AP
          and include the PCP/AP clustering control field in transmitted DMG Beacon frames.
 The PCP/AP shall not become a member of the centralized PCP/AP cluster if no Beacon SP is determined to
 be empty during aMinChannelTime or if the second non-PCP/non-AP STA did not associate to the S-AP, in
 which case the PCP/AP may attempt to join the cluster of another S-AP or cease its activity on this channel
 and, if desired, attempt operation on a different channel.
 A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall select a beacon interval that is equal to the
 beacon interval of the S-AP of the cluster.
 The member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall transmit its DMG Beacon frames with the
 ECPAC Policy Enforced subfield in the DMG Parameters field set to 1, the Beacon SP duration subfield in
 the Clustering Control field set to the value of the Beacon SP duration subfield contained in the most
 recently received S-AP DMG Beacon, the Cluster ID subfield set to the MAC address of the S-AP, the

Cluster Member Role subfield set to 2 (a member PCP/AP of the cluster), and the ClusterMaxMem subfields
set to the value of the ClusterMaxMem field contained in the S-AP DMG Beacon.
A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall include the ECPAC Policy element in
(Re)Association Response, Announce, and Information Response frames with the ECPAC Policy Detail,
TXSS CBAP Offset, and TXSS CBAP Duration fields set to the most recently received respective field from
the S-AP of the cluster, the TXSS CBAP MaxMem field set to the value of the TXSS CBAP MaxMem field
received from the S-AP of the cluster, with the CCSR ID set to the MAC address of the CCSR field received
from the S-AP of the cluster, and with the Available Cluster Time Offset Bitmap field reserved.
At any time a PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster transmits a DMG Beacon frame, the PCP/AP
shall schedule a Beacon SP that reserves time for BHI transmission by other PCPs/APs within the
centralized PCP/AP cluster at each in use ClusterTimeOffsetn-1 as indicated by the most recently transmitted
(if S-AP) or received (if member PCP/AP) Available Cluster Time Offset Bitmap. The minimum size of the
Beacon SP shall be equal to the value of the Beacon SP duration subfield within the DMG Beacon frame of
the S-AP of the centralized PCP/AP cluster. An S-AP/member PCP/member AP of a centralized PCP/AP
cluster shall not transmit or schedule transmissions during a Beacon SP of another S-AP/member PCP/
member AP.
9.34.3 Cluster maintenance
9.34.3.1 General cluster maintenance
The TBTT of the S-PCP/S-AP provides a timing reference for the Beacon SPs of the member PCPs/APs.
Timing synchronization among the member PCPs/APs facilitates equitable sharing of the common medium
among the member PCPs/APs. As long as a member PCP/AP periodically receives DMG Beacons from the
S-PCP/S-AP, the member PCP/AP is able to maintain synchronization with the S-PCP/S-AP and hence the
other member PCPs/APs.
9.34.3.2 Decentralized PCP/AP cluster maintenance
In the case when the S-PCP/S-AP of a decentralized PCP/AP cluster is lost, or appears to a member PCP/AP
to have been lost, another PCP/AP needs to become the S-PCP/S-AP of the decentralized PCP/AP cluster in
order to allow the remaining member PCPs/APs to maintain synchronization with the cluster. The creation
of a new S-PCP/S-AP is called S-PCP/S-AP handover. After an S-PCP/S-AP handover, the cluster might
continue to function as before, except with altered membership, or the cluster might no longer exist, or there
might be one or more new clusters.
A member PCP/AP of the decentralized PCP/AP cluster shall start an S-PCP/S-AP handover if, within a
time period of 4×aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals, it does not receive a DMG Beacon with the ECPAC
Policy Enforced field set to 0, with the value of the Cluster ID field equal to the Cluster ID of the cluster of
which the PCP/AP is a member and with the Cluster Member Role field set to the S-PCP/S-AP value. This is
the first Cluster Monitoring Period. During the next step in the S-PCP/S-AP handover, the member PCP/AP
performs another Cluster Monitoring Period. A Cluster Monitoring Period is a time period of
4×aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals during which the PCP/AP listens for DMG Beacons while continuing to
transmit DMG Beacons using its current Beacon SPn.
NOTE—A decentralized clustering enabled PCP/AP does not cease DMG Beacon transmission during Cluster
Monitoring and S-PCP/S-AP handover. Hence, data communication is unaffected while performing these procedures.
If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the member PCP/AP receives a DMG Beacon with the value of
Cluster Member Role set to the S-PCP/S-AP value, the member PCP/AP shall follow the rules in 9.34.2 to
become a member PCP/AP of the cluster corresponding to the detected S-PCP/S-AP or cease operation on
the channel; in either case, the Cluster Monitoring Period is terminated.

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                               LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the PCP/AP receives no DMG Beacons with the value of Cluster
 Member Role set to the S-PCP/S-AP value and one or more DMG Beacons with the ECPAC Policy
 Enforced field set to 0 and with Cluster ID equal to the Cluster ID of its last S-PCP/S-AP, then at the end of
 the Cluster Monitoring Period the PCP/AP compares the MAC addresses of all such received DMG Beacons
 with its own MAC address. If its MAC address is the lowest, the PCP/AP shall become an S-PCP/S-AP
 according to the rules in 9.34.2. If its MAC address is not the lowest, the PCP/AP shall perform a new
 Cluster Monitoring Period. If the number of Cluster Monitoring Periods performed by the PCP/AP exceeds
 dot11MaxNumberOfClusteringMonitoringPeriods, the PCP/AP may cease cluster maintenance and initiate
 cluster formation as described in 9.34.2.
 If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the PCP/AP does not receive a DMG Beacon that contains the
 value of S-PCP/S-AP in the Cluster Member Role field and does not receive a DMG Beacon with
 the ECPAC Policy Enforced field set to 0 and with Cluster ID equal to the Cluster ID of the cluster of
 which it is currently a member, then at the end of the Cluster Monitoring Period the PCP/AP may become an
 S-PCP/S-AP according to the rules of 9.34.2, or it may cease its activity on this channel and, if desired,
 attempt operation on a different channel.
 NOTE—An assumption to allow the establishment of an S-PCP/S-AP in this case is that the PCPs/APs cannot hear each
 other’s DMG Beacons. The rule how to decide to switch the channel or to establish an S-PCP/S-AP is implementation
 dependent.
 If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the member PCP/AP of a decentralized PCP/AP cluster receives no
 DMG Beacons from clustering enabled STAs, then the PCP/AP shall establish itself as an S-PCP/S-AP
 according to the rules in 9.34.2.
 If an S-PCP/S-AP of a decentralized PCP/AP cluster detects the presence of a S-PCP/S-AP of another
 decentralized PCP/AP cluster on the same channel, it should schedule a Beacon SP for the DMG Beacon
 transmission of the other S-PCP/S-AP if the MAC address of the other S-PCP/S-AP is lower than the MAC
 address of this S-PCP/S-AP. The S-PCP/S-AP with higher MAC address should become a member PCP/AP
 of the cluster corresponding to the S-PCP/S-AP with the lower MAC address according to the rules in
 9.34.2.
 9.34.3.3 Centralized PCP/AP cluster maintenance
 A STA, while operating as an S-AP, remains stationary with respect to its local environment.
 An S-AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, upon a change of the Beacon SP Duration field or the ECPAC
 Policy element configured by the CCSR, shall update the Clustering Control field sent in subsequent frames
 and shall send individually addressed Announce or Information Response frames to other STAs within the
 BSS in order notify them of the changes.
 When a member PCP/AP is coordinated by an MM-SME and the member PCP/AP elects to change its S-AP
 within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, then a second non-PCP/non-AP STA coordinated by the MM-SME of
 the member PCP/AP should disassociate from the previous S-AP, and the member PCP/AP shall perform
 the steps described in 9.34.2.2 that allow a clustering enabled PCP/AP to join the centralized PCP/AP cluster
 of an S-AP as a member PCP/AP.
 When a member PCP/AP is coordinated by an MM-SME and the member PCP/AP elects to change its
 Cluster Time Offset within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, then the member PCP/AP shall pass the updated
 Cluster Time Offset to a second non-PCP/non-AP STA coordinated by the MM-SME of the member PCP/
 AP, and the second non-PCP/non-AP STA shall send an Information Response frame that includes a Cluster
 Time Offset element containing the Cluster Time Offset Index set to the updated index to the S-AP of the
 centralized PCP/AP cluster.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                    Std 802.11ad-2012
A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, upon a change of the Clustering Control field
received from its S-AP, shall update the Clustering Control field sent in subsequent frames. Upon a change
of the ECPAC Policy Detail field received from its S-AP, a member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP
cluster shall update the ECPAC Policy element sent in subsequent frames and send individually addressed
Announce or Information Response frames to other STAs within the BSS in order notify them of the
changes. The member PCP/AP within the centralized PCP/AP cluster shall attempt to receive a DMG
Beacon frame from its S-AP at least once every dot11DMGEcssPolicyDetailUpdateDurationMax TUs.
In the case when a member PCP/AP of a cluster has not received DMG Beacon frames from its S-AP for a
duration exceeding 4×aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals, and the member PCP/AP intends to continue to
operate a BSS on the channel, the PCP/AP shall either
   —     Stop the current BSS then become an S-AP within the CCSS as described in 9.34.2.2; or
   —     Monitor the channel for DMG Beacon frames for an interval of length at least aMinChannelTime.
         During this period, if one or more DMG Beacon frames are received with the ECPAC Policy
         Enforced field set to 1 in the DMG Parameters field and the Cluster Member Role set to 1 (S-PCP/S-
         AP of cluster) from one or more S-APs, then the PCP/AP shall join a selected S-AP as a cluster
         member as described in 9.34.2.2. If, after the period elapses, no DMG Beacon frames are received
         with the ECPAC Policy Enforced field in the DMG Parameters field set to 1 and the Cluster
         Member Role set to 1 (S-PCP/S-AP of cluster) and if the PCP/AP is decentralized PCP/AP
         clustering capable, then the PCP/AP shall attempt to join a decentralized PCP/AP cluster if present
         as described in 9.34.2.1. If the PCP/AP is not decentralized PCP/AP clustering capable or a
         decentralized PCP/AP cluster is not present, then the PCP/AP shall set its Cluster Member Role to 0
         (not currently participating in a cluster). In either case, the PCP/AP
         —    Shall set the ECPAC Policy Enforced bit to 0 and shall not include the ECPAC Policy element
              in (Re)Association Response, Announce, or Information Response frames and
         —    Should send individually addressed Announce or Information Response frames to other STAs
              within the BSS to notify them of the changes.
9.34.3.4 Centralized PCP/AP cluster MAC requirements
If the most recent ECPAC Policy element transmitted by an S-AP/member PCP/member AP includes the
BHI Enforced field set to 1, the S-AP/member PCP/member AP shall complete the BTI, A-BFT, and ATI
for each subsequent beacon interval before TBTT + 8/1024×Beacon SP duration. The most recently
transmitted (if an S-AP) or received (if a member PCP/member AP or non-PCP/non-AP STA) value of
Beacon SP duration is used.
If the most recent ECPAC Policy element transmitted by an S-AP/member PCP/member AP has the TXSS
CBAP Enforced field set to 1, the S-AP/member PCP/member AP shall complete each of its TXSSs in the
DTI within one or more TXSS CBAPs.
If the most recent ECPAC Policy element, received by a non-PCP/non-AP STA in a BSS from the S-AP/
member PCP/member AP of the BSS, has the TXSS CBAP Enforced field set to 1, then the non-PCP/non-
AP STA shall perform each of its TXSSs in the DTI within one or more TXSS CBAPs. If the non-PCP/non-
AP STA is the source DMG STA of an SP and if the non-PCP/non-AP determines that it needs to perform a
TXSS before continuing to transmit to the destination DMG STA of the SP, then the non-PCP/non-AP STA
should truncate the SP (see 9.33.8).
A TXSS CBAP shall last from TBTT + 8×TXSS CBAP Offset + (n-1)×1024×beacon interval/TXSS CBAP
MaxMem until TBTT + 8×TXSS CBAP Offset + (n-1)×1024×beacon interval/TXSS CBAP MaxMem +
8×TXSS CBAP Duration for n = 1 to TXSS CBAP MaxMem, excluding any time that overlaps a BHI or an
SP that has source and destination DMG AIDs set to 255 (such as for a Beacon SP). The most recently
transmitted (if an S-AP) or received (if a member PCP/member AP or non-PCP/non-AP STA) value of
TXSS CBAP Offset and TXSS CBAP Duration fields are used.

 The TXSS CBAP is available to all STAs in an ECPAC. STAs may also use the TXSS CBAP for sending
 frames not related to transmit sector sweeping. Transmission rules during a TXSS CBAP are defined in
 9.33.5.
 NOTE—Frames, such as data frames, sent in a TXSS CBAP when the TXSS CBAP Enforced field is set to 1 might
 experience erratically higher interference than frames sent at other times due to the TXSSs of other nearby STAs.
 Additional centralized PCP/AP cluster requirements are defined in 9.33.6.6 and 10.1.3.2a.
 9.34.4 Cluster report and re-scheduling
 A clustering enabled PCP/AP that receives an Extended Schedule element from another clustering enabled
 PCP/AP may re-schedule SPs and CBAPs in its beacon interval, or move the BTI (10.1.3.2a), in an attempt
 to mitigate any interference with the transmissions indicated in the received Extended Schedule element.
 The PCP/AP can create SPs in its beacon interval with the source and destination AID set to 255 to prevent
 transmissions during specific periods in the beacon interval (9.33.6.2).
 A non-PCP/non-AP STA that is a member of a BSS and that receives a DMG Beacon should send a Cluster
 Report element to its PCP/AP if the received DMG Beacon frame meets all of the following conditions:
    —     The DMG Beacon is not from the STA’s PCP/AP.
    —     The DMG Beacon contains the Clustering Control field.
    —     Either
          —    The value of the Cluster ID field within the Clustering Control field is different from the MAC
               address of the STA’s PCP/AP; or
          —    The value of the Cluster ID field within the Clustering Control field is the same as the MAC
               address of the STA’s PCP/AP, the TBTTs of the two BSSs are less than dot11BeaconPeriod/
               (2×ClusterMemMax) apart in time, and the ECPAC Policy Enforced field in the DMG Beacon
               frame received most recently from the STA’s PCP/AP is equal to 1.
 The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not send a Cluster Report element to its PCP/AP if the received DMG
 Beacon frame does not meet the preceding conditions.
 A Cluster Report element meeting the conditions above shall be transmitted in an Announce or Information
 Response frame sent to the STA’s PCP/AP. Within the transmitted Cluster Report element, the STA shall set
 the Cluster report subfield to one. The STA shall set the Clustering Control field within a transmitted Cluster
 Report element to the corresponding field values within the Clustering Control of the received DMG
 Beacon, shall set the Reported BSSID field to the BSSID of the received DMG Beacon, and shall set the
 Reference timestamp field to indicate the DMG Beacon reception time. The STA shall set the Schedule
 present subfield to one if the Extended Schedule field is present in the transmitted Cluster Report element;
 otherwise, it shall set Schedule present subfield to zero. The STA shall set the TSCONST present subfield to
 one if the TSCONST field is present in the transmitted Cluster Report element; otherwise, it shall set
 TSCONST present subfield to zero.
 The STA shall set the ECPAC Policy Enforced field in the Cluster Report Control field to the value of the
 ECPAC Policy Enforced field in the received DMG Beacon. The STA should attempt to receive an
 Announce frame from the PCP/AP that transmitted the DMG Beacon according to the channel access rules
 described in 9.33 in order to solicit an ECPAC Policy element. If the STA obtains an ECPAC Policy element
 from the PCP/AP that transmitted the DMG Beacon, the STA shall set the ECPAC Policy Present subfield to
 1 and include the ECPAC Policy element in the transmitted Cluster Report element; otherwise, the STA
 shall set ECPAC Policy Present subfield to 0 and not include the ECPAC Policy element in the transmitted
 Cluster Report element. If present, the Extended Schedule Element field within the Cluster Report element
 shall be set to the corresponding field values within the Extended Schedule element of the received DMG
 Beacon. If present, the TSCONST field shall be set to indicate periods of time with respect to the TBTT of
 276                                                                            Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

the beacon interval of the BSS the STA participates where the transmitting STA experiences poor channel
conditions, such as due to interference.
If the received DMG Beacon contains more than one Extended Schedule element entry, the STA shall repeat
the aforementioned procedure and transmit a Cluster Report element corresponding to each Extended
Schedule element entry.
Upon receiving a Cluster Report element from a non-PCP/non-AP STA with the Cluster report field set to 1,
a clustering enabled PCP/AP may re-schedule SPs and CBAPs in its beacon interval, move the BTI if the
clustering enabled PCP/AP is an S-PCP/S-AP in a decentralized PCP/AP cluster, or change the Cluster Time
Offset if the clustering enabled PCP/AP is a member PCP/AP, or perform other actions, in an attempt to
mitigate any interference with the transmissions indicated in the received Cluster Report element. The
clustering enabled PCP/AP may also create SPs in its beacon interval with the source and destination AID
set to 255 to prevent transmissions during specific periods in the beacon interval.
A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster should report new interference information and
may report all interference information to the S-AP of the cluster
   —     When the member PCP/AP receives one or more of the following:
         —     A DMG Beacon frame from another PCP/AP in another centralized PCP/AP cluster within the
               same CCSS or another CCSS
         —     A Cluster Report element with the Cluster Report field set to 1 from a non-PCP/non-AP STA
               within the same BSS characterizing a PCP/AP in another centralized PCP/AP cluster within the
               same CCSS or another CCSS; and
   —     If at least dot11DMGEcssClusterReportDurationMin TUs have elapsed since the last report.
The report should aggregate the information received from all sources and minimize duplication. The
member PCP/AP passes the report to a second non-PCP/non-AP STA coordinated by the MM-SME of the
member PCP/AP, and the second non-PCP/non-AP STA sends the report in an Information Response frame
that includes one or more Cluster Report elements to the S-AP of its centralized PCP/AP cluster. If the
member PCP/AP does not elect to change its Cluster Time Offset at this time, the second non-PCP/non-AP
STA includes a Cluster Time Offset element with an unchanged Cluster Time Offset Index field.
Via an unspecified means, the S-AP might aggregate received DMG Beacon frames and Cluster Report
elements and send the aggregate to the CCSR. Upon receiving this information, the CCSR might reconfigure
the TSF offsets of an S-AP, reconfigure the ECPAC Policy Detail of an S-AP, update the Cluster Time
Offset availability information provided in an individually addressed frame by an S-AP to a member PCP/
AP, or perform other actions.
9.34.5 Decentralized PCP/AP cluster request
A non-PCP/non-AP STA that is a member of a BSS may transmit a Cluster Report element to its PCP/AP to
request that decentralized PCP/AP clustering be enabled in the BSS. The non-PCP/non-AP STA can make
this request if, for example, the device containing the non-PCP/non-AP STA intends to initialize another co-
channel BSS (10.1) in which it performs the role of PCP/AP and, when performing this role, it wishes to
become a member PCP/AP of the decentralized PCP/AP clustering enabled by its current PCP/AP.
To request PCP/AP clustering to be enabled in the BSS, the STA shall transmit a Cluster Report element
with the Cluster request subfield set to 1 to its PCP/AP. Upon receiving a Cluster Report element with the
Cluster request subfield set to 1, the PCP/AP should form and maintain decentralized PCP/AP clustering in
the BSS according to the procedures described in 9.34.2 and 9.34.3. In doing that, the PCP/AP should set the
minimum duration of the Beacon SP to be equal to the Beacon SP duration.

 If the non-PCP/non-AP STA does not receive a DMG Beacon frame from its PCP/AP with decentralized
 PCP/AP clustering enabled after dot11ClusterEnableTime following the transmission to its PCP/AP of a
 Cluster Report element with the Cluster request subfield set to 1, the non-PCP/non-AP STA may transmit an
 Announce frame including the last Extended Schedule element transmitted by the PCP/AP. If the Announce
 frame is transmitted, it shall use MCS 0, and the TA field shall be set to the broadcast address. If a DMG
 STA receives an Announce frame with the TA field set to the broadcast address and with the BSSID field
 different from the BSSID of its BSS, the DMG STA may send a Cluster Report element containing the
 Extended Schedule element within the received Announce frame to its PCP/AP, which might be used by the
 PCP/AP to reschedule SPs in portions of the beacon interval that are nonoverlapping in time with the SPs
 contained in the Extended Schedule element reported by the DMG STA.
 If a non-PCP/non-AP STA becomes a member PCP/AP of the clustering enabled by its current PCP/AP, the
 non-PCP/non-AP STA can synchronize scheduled CBAP allocations, if any, between the BSS in which it
 performs the role of PCP/AP and the BSS of its current PCP/AP. The non-PCP/non-AP STA can disallow
 STAs in the BSS in which it plays the role of PCP/AP from transmitting during the Beacon SPs of the cluster
 it is a part of, and this can be done by allocating an SP time-overlapping with each Beacon SP such that each
 allocated SP has both the source AID and destination AID fields within the Extended Schedule element set
 to the AID of the non-PCP/non-AP STA.
 9.35 DMG beamforming
 9.35.1 General
 Beamforming (BF) is a mechanism that is used by a pair of STAs to achieve the necessary DMG link budget
 for subsequent communication. BF training is a bidirectional sequence of BF training frame transmissions
 that uses sector sweep and provides the necessary signaling to allow each STA to determine appropriate
 antenna system settings for both transmission and reception. After the successful completion of BF training,
 BF is said to be established. A BF training frame is an SSW frame, a DMG Beacon frame or a BRP frame.
 Figure 9-48 gives an example of the beamforming training procedure.

 In this subclause, the STA that initiates BF training through the transmission of a BF frame is referred to as
 the initiator, and the recipient STA of the BF frame that participates in BF training with the initiator is
 referred to as the responder. For BF training that occurs within the A-BFT allocation, the PCP/AP is the

initiator and a non-PCP/non-AP STA becomes the responder. For BF training that occurs during an SP
allocation, the source DMG STA of the SP is the initiator and the destination DMG STA of the SP becomes
the responder. For BF training during a TXOP allocation, the TXOP holder is the initiator and the TXOP
responder is the responder.
The link from the initiator to the responder is referred to as the initiator link and the link from the responder
to the initiator is referred to as the responder link.
BF training starts with a SLS from the initiator. A beam refinement protocol (BRP) may follow, if requested
by either the initiator or the responder. The purpose of the SLS phase is to enable communications between
the two participating STAs at the control PHY rate or higher MCS. Normally, the SLS phase provides only
transmit BF training. The purpose of the BRP phase is to enable receiver training and enable iterative
refinement of the AWV of both transmitter and receiver at both participating STAs. If one of the
participating STAs chooses to use only one transmit antenna pattern, receive training may be performed as
part of the SLS.
Any BF information obtained by an initiator or a responder during a BF training attempt shall be considered
invalid if either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:
   a)    The SLS phase was not completed within dot11MaxBFTime beacon intervals from the start of the
         SLS phase.
   b)    The BRP phase, if initiated, was not completed within dot11MaxBFTime beacon intervals from the
         start of the BRP phase.
A STA shall abort an SLS if the SLS is not completed within dot11MaxBFTime beacon intervals from the
start of the SLS, and shall abort a BRP if the BRP is not completed within dot11MaxBFTime beacon
intervals from the start of the BRP.
The number of sectors per DMG antenna shall not be greater than 64. The total number of sectors across all
DMG antennas in a STA shall not be greater than 128.

 An SLS between an initiator and a responder is successful for the initiator if, after the completion of the

 during the SLS.

9.35.2 Sector-level sweep (SLS) phase
9.35.2.1 General
The SLS phase can include as many as four components: an initiator sector sweep (ISS) to train the initiator
link as described in 9.35.2.2, a responder sector sweep (RSS) to train the responder link as described in
9.35.2.3, an SSW Feedback as described in 9.35.2.4, and an SSW ACK as described in 9.35.2.5.
An initiator shall begin the SLS phase by transmitting the frames of the ISS.
A responder shall not begin transmitting the frames of an RSS before the ISS is successfully completed,
except when the ISS occurs in the BTI (9.35.5).
An initiator shall not begin an SSW Feedback before the RSS phase is successfully completed, except when
the RSS occurs in the A-BFT.
A responder shall not begin an SSW ACK with an initiator in the A-BFT. A responder shall begin an SSW
ACK with an initiator immediately following the successful completion of the SSW Feedback with the
initiator.
During the SLS phase the only BF frames an initiator may transmit are the DMG Beacon frame, the SSW
frame, and the SSW-Feedback frame. During the SLS phase the only BF frames a responder may transmit
are the SSW frame and the SSW-ACK frame.
If during the SLS the initiator and responder each execute a TXSS, then at the end of the SLS phase both the
initiator and the responder possess their own transmit sector. If either the ISS or the RSS employs a receive
sector sweep, then the responder or the initiator, respectively, possesses its own receive sector.
The following rule applies to all channel access in DMG BSSs. A STA shall not transmit a frame as part of a
sector sweep comprising at least two sectors if a response is expected within SIFS interval from the STA
identified in the RA field of the transmitted frame.
A STA shall not change its transmit power during a sector sweep.
Two examples of the SLS phases are shown in Figure 9-49 and Figure 9-50.
In Figure 9-49 the initiator has many sectors, the responder has only one transmit sector and receive sector
sweep is used at the responder sector sweep (the responder is transmitting all responder SSW frames through
the same transmit sector, the initiator is switching receive antennas at the same time).
In Figure 9-50 the initiator has many transmit sectors, the responder has one transmit sector. In this case,
receive training for the initiator is performed in the BRP phase.

An initiator may employ either DMG Beacon frames or SSW frames in the ISS. If the initiator begins an ISS
with the transmission of a DMG Beacon frame, it shall use the DMG Beacon frame for all subsequent
transmissions during the ISS. Conversely, if the initiator begins an ISS with the transmission of an SSW
frame, it shall use the SSW frame for all subsequent transmissions during the ISS. A responder never begins
an ISS.
The Duration field within each transmitted DMG Beacon frame is set to the time remaining until the end of
the current BTI (see 9.35.4). The Duration field of each transmitted SSW frame shall be set to the time
remaining until the end of the ISS or the end of the current allocation, whichever is earlier.
The initiator shall set the Direction subfield in the Sector Sweep field to 0 within each DMG Beacon and
SSW frame transmitted during an ISS.
The initiator shall set the Total Sectors in ISS subfield within the SSW Feedback field to the total number of
sectors that it is using in the ISS. The total is computed as the sum of all sectors employed on all antennas in
the ISS multiplied by the number of the responder’s receive DMG antennas. For example, if 4 sectors are
used on antenna 0, 3 sectors on antenna 1, 5 sectors on antenna 2, and the responder has two receive DMG
antennas, then the Total Sectors in ISS subfield is set to 24.
9.35.2.2.2 Initiator TXSS
When the IsInitiatorTXSS field for a specific SP is 1 in a received Extended Schedule element (see
8.4.2.134) or Grant frame (see 8.3.1.13) and the Beamforming Training field of the BF Control field for that
SP in the same Extended Schedule element or Grant frame is 1, then the SP contains an initiator TXSS, and
the initiator shall start an initiator TXSS at the start of the next SP as indicated by the received Extended
Schedule element or Grant frame.
During the BTI, the initiator shall start an initiator TXSS (see also 9.35.4).
During a CBAP, an initiator may obtain a TXOP with an initiator TXSS or may transmit a Grant frame to
the responder with the Beamforming Training and IsInitiatorTXSS fields of the BF Control field set to 1. A
responder that receives such a Grant frame in a CBAP and that has the Grant ACK Supported field equal to
1 in the responder’s DMG Capabilities element shall respond with a Grant ACK frame SIFS interval after
the reception of the Grant frame. In the Grant ACK frame, the responder shall set the Beamforming Training
field to 1. The initiator starts the initiator TXSS SIFS interval after the reception of the Grant ACK frame if
the Grant ACK Supported field in the responder’s DMG Capabilities element is 1 or PIFS interval after the
transmission the Grant frame otherwise. To transmit a Grant frame during a TXOP, the TXOP holder shall
first terminate the TXOP by transmitting a CF-End frame followed by the transmission of the Grant frame
PIFS interval after the end of the last CF-End frame transmission.
During an initiator TXSS, the Sector ID field in each BF frame shall be set to a value that uniquely identifies
the transmit antenna sector employed when the BF frame is transmitted. The CDOWN field in each
transmitted frame shall contain the total number of transmissions remaining until the end of the initiator
TXSS, such that the last BF frame transmission of the initiator TXSS has the CDOWN field set to 0. Each
transmitted BF frame shall be separated by a time interval equal to SBIFS, unless the allocation ends as
described in 9.35.6. This is indicated in Figure 9-51.
If the initiator has more than one DMG antenna, the initiator transmits the BF frame through a number of
sectors equal to the value of the last negotiated Total Number of Sectors field that was transmitted by the
initiator to the responder. In each transmitted BF frame, the initiator shall set the Sector ID and DMG
Antenna ID fields to uniquely identify the sector and the DMG Antenna ID, respectively, the initiator is
using for the frame transmission and shall set the CDOWN field to the total number of transmissions
remaining from all of the initiator’s DMG antennas. The initiator shall transmit from its DMG antennas in
increasing order of Antenna ID.

 For an ISS outside the BTI and if the responder has more than one DMG antenna, the initiator repeats its
 initiator sector sweep for the number of DMG antennas indicated by the responder in the last negotiated
 Number of RX DMG Antennas field that was transmitted by the responder. Repetitions of the initiator sector
 sweep are separated by an interval equal to LBIFS time. In this case CDOWN indicates the number of
 sectors until the end of transmission from all initiator’s DMG antennas to all responder’s DMG antennas. At
 the start of an initiator TXSS, the responder should have its first receive DMG antenna configured to a
 quasi-omni pattern and should not change its receive antenna configuration for a time corresponding to the
 value of the last negotiated Total Number of Sectors field transmitted by the initiator multiplied by the time
 to transmit a single SSW frame, plus appropriate IFSs (9.3.2.3). After this time, the responder may switch to
 a quasi-omni pattern in another DMG antenna.
 The initiator TXSS ends at the end time of the BF frame from the initiator with the CDOWN field set to 0. If
 the responder is unable to receive this frame, the responder shall assume that the initiator TXSS has
 completed at the expected end time of this frame.
 9.35.2.2.3 Initiator RXSS
 An initiator RXSS may be requested only when an initiator is aware of the capabilities of a responder, which
 includes the RXSS Length field. An initiator can obtain the capabilities of a responder using the Information
 Request and Response procedure as described in 10.29.1.
 When the IsInitiatorTXSS field for a specific SP in a received Extended Schedule element or Grant frame is
 0 and the Beamforming Training field of the BF Control field for that SP in the same Extended Schedule
 element or Grant frame is 1, then the SP shall contain an initiator RXSS, and the initiator shall start an
 initiator RXSS at the start of the next SP described by the received Extended Schedule element or Grant
 frame.
 The initiator never performs an initiator RXSS during the BTI.
 During a CBAP, an initiator shall not obtain a TXOP with an initiator RXSS. Within a CBAP, an initiator
 may transmit a Grant frame to the responder with the Beamforming Training field set to 1 and the
 IsInitiatorTXSS field set to 0. A responder that receives such a Grant frame in a CBAP and that has the
 Grant ACK Supported field equal to 1 in the responder’s DMG Capabilities element shall respond with a
 Grant ACK frame SIFS interval after the reception of the Grant frame. In the Grant ACK frame, the
 responder shall set the Beamforming Training field to 1. The initiator starts the initiator RXSS SIFS interval
 after the reception of the Grant ACK frame if the Grant ACK Supported field in the responder’s DMG
 Capabilities element is 1 or PIFS interval after the transmission the Grant frame otherwise.
 During the initiator RXSS, the initiator shall transmit from each of the initiator’s DMG antennas the number
 of BF frames indicated by the responder in the last negotiated RXSS Length field transmitted by the

responder. Each transmitted BF frame shall be transmitted with the same fixed antenna sector or pattern. The
initiator shall set the Sector ID and DMG Antenna ID fields in each transmitted BF frame to a value that
uniquely identifies the single sector through which the BF frame is transmitted. The initiator shall set the
CDOWN field in each transmitted BF frame to contain the total number of transmissions remaining to the
end of the initiator RXSS, such that the last BF frame transmission of the initiator RXSS has the CDOWN
field set to 0. Each transmitted BF frame shall be separated by a time interval equal to SBIFS, except if the
allocation ends as described in 9.35.6. This is indicated in Figure 9-51.
During an initiator RXSS, the responder should have its receive antenna array configured to sweep RXSS
Length sectors for each of the initiator’s DMG antennas while attempting to receive SSW frames from the
initiator.
The initiator RXSS ends at the end time of the SSW frame from the initiator with the CDOWN field set to 0.
If the responder is unable to receive this frame, the responder shall assume that the initiator RXSS has
completed at the expected end time of this frame.
9.35.2.3 Responder Sector Sweep
9.35.2.3.1 General
An RSS comprises either a responder TXSS or a responder RXSS.
A responder RXSS may be performed in an RSS when the responder chooses to use only one transmit
antenna pattern across each of its DMG antennas.
The responder initiates an RSS with the transmission of an SSW frame, which is the only frame allowed
during an RSS.
The responder shall set the Direction subfield in the Sector Sweep field to 1 within each SSW frame
transmitted during an RSS.
The Duration field within each transmitted SSW frame shall be set to the time remaining until the end of the
RSS or the end of the current allocation (i.e., SP, TXOP or SSW slot in the case of the A-BFT), whichever
comes first.
9.35.2.3.2 Responder TXSS
If the DMG Beacon immediately preceding an A-BFT contained a value of one in the IsResponderTXSS
subfield of the Beacon Interval Control field, then the A-BFT is a responder TXSS A-BFT.
When the IsResponderTXSS field for a specific SP in a received Extended Schedule element or Grant frame
is 1 and the Beamforming Training field of the BF Control field for that SP in the same Extended Schedule
element or Grant frame is 1, then the SP contains a responder TXSS, and the responder shall initiate a TXSS
following the completion of the ISS in the SP described by the received Extended Schedule element or Grant
frame.
When the RXSS Length field within an SSW frame used to obtain a TXOP during a CBAP is 0, the
responder shall initiate a TXSS following the completion of the ISS in the TXOP described by the received
SSW frame.
During a responder TXSS, the responder shall set the Sector ID and the DMG Antenna ID fields in each
transmitted SSW frame to a value that uniquely identifies the sector through which the SSW frame is
transmitted. The initial value of CDOWN is set to the total number of sectors in the responder (covering all
DMG antennas) multiplied by the number of DMG antennas at the initiator minus one. The responder shall

 set the CDOWN field in each transmitted SSW frame to contain the total number of transmissions remaining
 to the end of the responder TXSS, such that the last SSW frame transmission of the responder TXSS has the
 CDOWN field set to 0. The responder shall transmit from its DMG antennas in increasing order of Antenna
 ID. Each transmitted SSW frame shall be separated by an interval of time equal to SBIFS. Transmissions are
 not separated by SBIFS if the allocation ends as described in 9.35.4 and 9.35.6 or if the end of an SSW slot
 is reached as described in 9.35.5 or when the responder completed a full sweep of all its transmit sectors and
 is ready to transmit to another DMG antenna of the initiator. In the latter case, the next transmission is
 separated from the previous transmission by LBIFS interval. This is indicated in Figure 9-52.

 A responder that has more than one DMG antenna and has set the value of the DMG Antenna Reciprocity
 field in its DMG Capabilities element to 0 transmits sequentially through all the sectors of all of its DMG
 antennas. A responder that has more than one DMG antenna and has set the value of the DMG Antenna
 Reciprocity field in the responder’s DMG Capabilities element to 1 transmits through the DMG antenna
 from which it had the best reception in the initiator sector sweep. The length of the sector sweep to each of
 the initiator’s DMG antennas is not dependent on the value of the DMG Antenna Reciprocity field.
 A responder that has only one DMG antenna should transmits through all its sectors, regardless of the setting
 of the DMG Antenna Reciprocity field.
 The responder shall set the Sector Select field and the DMG Antenna Select field in each transmitted SSW
 frame to the value of the Sector ID field and DMG Antenna ID field, respectively, of the frame received with
 the best quality during the ISS. The determination of which frame is received with best quality is
 implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this standard. The responder shall set the SNR Report
 field to the SNR measured for the frame indicated by the Sector Select field and DMG Antenna Select field.
 If the initiator has more than one DMG antenna, the responder repeats its responder sector sweep for the
 number of DMG antennas indicated by the initiator in the last negotiated Number of RX DMG Antennas
 field transmitted by the initiator. At the start of a responder TXSS, the initiator should have its receive
 antenna array configured to a quasi-omni antenna pattern in one of its DMG antennas for a time
 corresponding to the value of the last negotiated Total Number of Sectors field transmitted by the responder
 multiplied by the time to transmit a single SSW frame, plus any appropriate IFSs (9.3.2.3). After this time,
 the initiator may switch to a quasi-omni pattern in another DMG antenna.
 The responder TXSS ends at the end time of the SSW frame from the responder with the CDOWN field set
 to 0. If the initiator is unable to receive this frame, the initiator shall assume that the responder TXSS has
 completed at the expected end time of this frame.

9.35.2.3.3 Responder RXSS
If the DMG Beacon immediately preceding an A-BFT contained a value of zero in the IsResponderTXSS
subfield of the Beacon Interval Control field within the DMG Beacon, then the A-BFT is a responder RXSS
A-BFT.
When the IsResponderTXSS field for a specific SP in a received Extended Schedule element or Grant frame
is 0 and the Beamforming Training field of the BF Control field for that SP in the same Extended Schedule
element or Grant frame is 1, then the SP contains a responder RXSS, and the responder shall initiate an
RXSS following the completion of the ISS in the SP described by the received Extended Schedule element
or Grant frame.
When the RXSS Length field within an SSW frame used to obtain a TXOP during a CBAP is equal to a
nonzero value, the responder shall initiate an RXSS following the completion of the ISS in the TXOP
described by the received SSW frame.
During the responder RXSS, the responder shall transmit the number of SSW frames indicated by the
initiator in the initiator’s most recently transmitted RXSS Length field (non-A-BFT) or FSS field (A-BFT)
from each of the responder’s DMG antennas, each time with the same antenna sector or pattern fixed for all
SSW frames transmission originating from the same DMG antenna. The responder shall set the Sector ID
and DMG Antenna ID fields in each transmitted frame to a value that uniquely identifies the sector and
DMG antenna, respectively, through which the BF frame is transmitted. The responder shall set the
CDOWN field in each transmitted SSW frame to contain the total number of transmissions remaining until
the end of the responder RXSS, such that the last SSW frame transmission of the responder RXSS has the
CDOWN field equal to zero. Each transmitted SSW frame shall be separated by an interval of time equal to
SBIFS, except if the allocation ends as described in 9.35.6 or if the end of an SSW slot is reached as
described in 9.35.5. This is indicated in Figure 9-52.
The responder shall set the Sector Select field and the DMG Antenna Select field in each transmitted SSW
frame to the value of the Sector ID field and the DMG Antenna ID field, respectively, of the frame received
with the best quality during the ISS. The determination of which frame is received with best quality is
implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this standard.
At the start of a responder RXSS, the initiator should have its receive antenna array configured to sweep
over RXSS Length sectors for each of the responder DMG antennas when it attempts to receive frames from
the responder until the completion of the responder RXSS.
The responder RXSS ends at the end time of the SSW frame from the responder with the CDOWN field set
to 0. If the initiator is unable to receive this frame, the initiator shall assume that the responder RXSS has
completed at the expected end time of this frame.

Sector Sweep Feedback (SSW Feedback) occurs following each RSS.
During SSW Feedback, the initiator shall transmit an SSW-Feedback frame to the responder.
During SSW Feedback, the responder should have its receive antenna array configured to a quasi-omni
antenna pattern in the DMG antenna through which it received with the highest quality during the ISS, or to
the best antenna configuration it has found during RXSS if RXSS has been performed during the ISS, and
should not change its receive antenna configuration when it communicates with the initiator until the
expected end of the SSW Feedback.

 When responder TXSS was performed during the preceding RSS, the initiator shall set the Sector Select
 field and the DMG Antenna Select field in the SSW-Feedback frame it transmits to the value of the Sector
 ID field and DMG Antenna ID field, respectively, of the frame received with the best quality during the
 responder TXSS. The determination of which frame is received with the best quality is implementation
 dependent and beyond the scope of this standard. In addition, the initiator shall set the SNR Report field to
 the SNR measured for the frame received by the sector and DMG antenna indicated by the Sector Select
 field and DMG Antenna Select field. The SSW-Feedback frame shall be transmitted through the sector
 identified by the value of the Sector Select field and DMG Antenna Select field received from the responder
 during the preceding responder TXSS.
 When responder RXSS was performed during the preceding RSS, the Sector Select field and the DMG
 Antenna select field in the transmitted SSW-Feedback frame are reserved. The initiator shall set the SNR
 Report field to the SNR measured on the frame on the receive sector designated by the RSS. The SSW-
 Feedback frame shall be transmitted through the sector identified by the value of the Sector Select field
 received from the responder during its most recently completed RSS with the initiator.
 In the transmitted SSW-Feedback frame, the initiator shall set the TX-TRN-REQ field to one if it desires to
 have transmitter training as part of the beam refinement phase and shall set the L-RX field to indicate the
 length of the training sequence it requests the responder to use in the beam refinement phase. If the initiator
 desires to carry out the MIDC subphase as part of the beam refinement, it shall set the BC-REQ field to 1 to
 request a BC subphase and shall set the MID-REQ field to 1 to request an MID subphase; in this case, the L-
 RX field shall be set to indicate the number of receive AWVs the initiator uses during the MID subphase.
 If the responder receives an SSW-Feedback frame from the initiator before it completes the RSS with the
 initiator such as described in 9.35.5, the responder may cease the RSS.
 9.35.2.5 Sector Sweep ACK
 When present, the Sector Sweep ACK (SSW ACK) occurs following an SSW Feedback.
 When a responder TXSS is performed during an RSS, the responder shall transmit an SSW-ACK frame to
 the initiator to perform an SSW ACK. The SSW-ACK frame shall be transmitted through the sector
 identified by the value of the Sector Select field and the DMG Antenna Select field received from the
 initiator in the last SSW Feedback.
 When an RXSS was performed during an RSS, an SSW-ACK frame shall be sent by the responder to the
 initiator. The SSW-ACK should be sent by the DMG antenna indicated in the DMG Antenna Select field in
 the last SSW-Feedback frame.
 In the transmitted SSW-ACK frame, the responder shall set the TX-TRN-REQ field to one if it requires
 transmitter training as part of the beam refinement phase and shall set the L-RX field to indicate the length
 of the training sequence it requests the initiator to use in the beam refinement phase as described in 8.4a.4. If
 the responder desires to carry out a MID subphase, it sets the MID-REQ bit to 1 in the BRP Request field of
 the SSW frame. In this case, it shall also set the L-RX field to indicate the number of receive AWVs it uses
 during the MID subphase. If the responder desires to carry out a BC subphase, it sets the BC-REQ bit to 1. If
 the initiator has set either the MID-REQ or the BC-REQ fields to 1 in the SSW-Feedback frame, the
 responder may set the MID-Grant or the BC-Grant fields to 1, or both, to grant the requests.
 At the start of an SSW ACK, the initiator should have its receive antenna array configured to a quasi-omni
 antenna pattern using the DMG antenna through which it received with the highest quality during the RSS,
 or the best receive sector if an RXSS has been performed during the RSS, and should not change its receive
 antenna configuration while it attempts to receive from the responder until the expected end of the SSW
 ACK.

9.35.3 Beam Refinement Protocol (BRP) phase
9.35.3.1 General
BRP is a process in which a STA trains its RX and TX antenna array(s) and improves its TX antenna
configuration and RX antenna configuration using an iterative procedure. BRP may be used regardless of
the antenna configuration a STA supports.
The BRP phase is composed of a BRP setup subphase, a Multiple sector ID Detection (MID) subphase, a
Beam Combining (BC) subphase, a subset of the previous subphases, and one or more beam refinement
transactions. BRP setup allows STAs to exchange beam refinement capability information and to request the
execution of the other BRP subphases. MID and BC (collectively, the MIDC subphase) are optionally used
to find better initial AWVs for iterative beam refinement than might have been found by SLS due to
imperfect quasi-omni receive antenna patterns. In MID, a quasi-omni transmit pattern is tested against a
number of receive AWVs; this reverses the scanning roles from the transmit sector sweep. In BC, a small set
of transmit and receive AWVs are tested in pairwise combinations, thus avoiding the use of quasi-omni
patterns. Finally, given the starting point from SLS or MIDC, STAs can explore a broader set of transmit
and receive AWVs using a request/response exchange referred to as a beam refinement transaction.
The BRP setup subphase may be skipped if the BRP follows an SSW-ACK frame and no MID or BC
subphases were requested during the SLS. MID and BC subphases can be skipped if either STA indicates
that the subphase is not needed by setting the MID-REQ and BC-REQ fields to 0 or by setting the MID-
Grant and BC-Grant fields to 0. The beam refinement transaction can be skipped if both sides indicate that
the transaction is not needed by setting the L-RX and TX-TRN-REQ fields to 0.
The BRP setup phase is defined in 9.35.3.2.
The MID subphase is composed of either an R-MID subphase or an I-MID subphase or both, which are
composed of one or more transmissions of BRP-RX packets (21.10.2.2), followed by feedback contained in
the next BRP frames from the initiator and responder.
The BC subphase is composed of either an R-BC subphase or an I-BC subphase or both, which are
composed of transmission of BRP-RX packets to select a beam, followed by feedback.
A beam refinement transaction is a set of BRP frames consisting of beam refinement requests and responses.
A beam refinement request can be either a transmit beam refinement request or a receive beam refinement
request or both.
A transmit beam refinement request (TX-TRN-REQ field within the BRP Request field set to 1) indicates
the need for transmit antenna array training by the transmitting STA. The BRP packet that has the TX-TRN-
REQ set to 1 (or the next BRP packet from this STA) shall include transmit training (TRN-T) subfields
appended to it. The STA responding to the BRP packet shall include feedback based on measurements it
performed during the reception of the BRP packet. The feedback type is dictated by the FBCK-TYPE field
within the DMG Beam Refinement element contained in the BRP packet.
A receive beam refinement request (L-RX field within the BRP Request field greater than zero) indicates the
need of the receive antenna array training for the transmitting STA. The responding STA shall respond with
a BRP packet with receive training (TRN-R) subfields appended to it.
Requests and responses can be combined in the same frame. As an example, the same frame can be both a
transmit beam refinement request and a receive beam refinement request. The same frame can also be
used as receive beam refinement response and a receive beam refinement request. See the example in
Figure 9-53.

                        Figure 9-53—An example of a beam refinement transaction
 Beam refinement responses are separated from beam refinement requests by at least a SIFS interval and at
 most a BRPIFS interval provided sufficient time is available for the complete transmission of those frames
 within the allocation. Similarly, a beam refinement request, if any, is separated from a preceding beam
 refinement response by at least a SIFS interval and at most a BRPIFS interval provided sufficient time is
 available for the complete transmission of the beam refinement request within the allocation.
 When performing BRP, if a responding STA requires longer than SIFS to transmit a BRP frame as a
 response for beam refinement training request from a requesting STA, the responding STA should keep the
 IFS not longer than SIFS by transmitting one or more PPDUs to the requesting STA.
 When the beam refinement occurs within the same allocation as the SLS, the SLS initiator is the beam
 refinement initiator. If the beam refinement occurs in a separate allocation, the STA that transmits the first
 beam refinement request is the beam refinement initiator. The other STA is the beam refinement responder.
 A beam refinement transaction is complete when the initiator determines that it does not need further
 training and it has received a BRP frame with no training requests from the beam refinement responder.
 In Figure 9-53, the first packet (from the initiator) has TX-TRN-REQ=1, the L-RX field has a value greater
 than zero and TRN-T subfields are appended to the packet. The second packet (from the responder) has a
 value greater than zero in the L-RX field, the TX-train-response field set to 1, the RX-train-response field set
 to 1, and TRN-R subfields are appended to the packet. The last packet (from the initiator) has RX-train-
 response set to 1 and TRN-R subfields are appended to the packet.
 9.35.3.2 BRP setup subphase
 The BRP setup subphase is used to exchange the intent and capabilities to conduct some or all of the
 subphases and beam refinement transactions in a subsequent BRP phase. The BRP setup subphase is used to
 set up the MIDC subphase, but can also be used to set up beam refinement transactions.
 The BRP setup subphase shall be used in the following two cases:
    —      When the RSS part of the SLS phase occurred in an A-BFT, in which case the SSW-ACK frame was
           not part of the SLS.

   —     When the initiator set the MID-REQ or BC-REQ fields in the SSW-Feedback frame to 1 or the
         responder set the MID-REQ or BC-REQ fields in the SSW-ACK frame to 1.
The BRP setup subphase starts with the initiator sending a BRP packet with the Capability Request subfield
set to 1 and with the remaining subfields within the BRP Request field set according to the initiator’s need
for an MID subphase, a BC subphase, and a beam refinement subphase. The BRP setup subphase can also
start when the responder grants a MID-REQ or BC-REQ through the SSW-ACK frame or when the
responder requests MID or BC in the SSW-ACK frame. Upon receiving a BRP packet with the Capability
Request subfield set to 1, the responder shall respond with a BRP packet with the subfields within the BRP
Request field set according to the responder’s desire for an MID subphase, a BC subphase and a beam
refinement subphase. This process is repeated until the responder transmits to the initiator a BRP packet
with the Capability Request subfield set to 0 and the initiator sends as a response a BRP packet with the
Capability Request subfield also set to 0. The BRP packet from the initiator that initiates the termination of
the BRP setup subphase can be the first BRP packet of the BRP phase, either as part of beam refinement or
as part of a MID or BC subphase.
A DMG STA (either initiator or responder) requests a MID subphase with MID and BC subphases (see
9.35.6.3.2) by setting both the MID-REQ and BC-REQ subfields to 1 in the BRP Request field of an SSW-
Feedback, SSW-ACK or BRP frame. It shall also set the L-RX subfield in the BRP Request field to the
number of RX AWV settings it needs in each BRP-RX packet during the MID subphase. The peer DMG
STA grants the request by setting the MID-Grant and BC-Grant subfields to 1 in the BRP Request field
within the next SSW-ACK or BRP frame transmitted to the requesting DMG STA. If either the MID or BC
were not granted by the peer STA, the MID and BC subphases shall not occur.
A DMG STA (either initiator or responder) requests an MID only subphase (see 9.35.6.3.3) by setting the
MID-REQ subfield to 1 in the BRP Request field of an SSW-Feedback, SSW-ACK or BRP frame. The STA
shall also set the L-RX subfield in the BRP Request field to the number of RX AWV settings it needs in each
BRP-RX packet during the MID-subphase. The peer DMG STA grants the request by setting the MID-
Grant subfield to 1 in the BRP Request field within the next SSW-ACK or BRP frame transmitted to the
requesting DMG STA. The Capability Request subfield and request subfields (TX-TRN-REQ, L-RX, MID-
REQ, BC-REQ) within the granting frame shall be set to 0.
If the MID-REQ was granted, the requesting STA shall transmit a BRP frame with the SNR Present and
Sector ID Order Present subfields set to 1 and with the Nmeas field in the FBCK-TYPE field indicating the
number of SNR measurements from the last SLS phase. In the Channel Measurement Feedback element, the
requesting STA sets the SNR subfields to the SNRs corresponding to the TX sectors received during the
SLS phase. In the Sector ID Order subfield, the requesting STA lists the sector IDs of the received sectors.
The Capability Request field within the BRP frame shall be set to 0. The MID subphase starts with the
transmission of a BRP packet from the peer STA after the reception of the list of sectors. A STA that has
granted a MID only request shall not request MID or BC in the response packet. The STA may request MID
or BC in the last packet it transmits to the requesting STA as part of the MID. The MID only subphase shall
not occur if it was not granted by the peer STA.
A DMG STA (either initiator or responder) requests a BC only subphase (see 9.35.6.3.4) by setting the BC-
REQ subfield to 1 in the BRP Request field of an SSW-Feedback, SSW-ACK, or BRP frame. The peer
DMG STA (either a responder or initiator) grants the request by setting the BC-Grant subfield to 1 in the
BRP Request field within the next SSW-ACK or BRP frame transmitted to the requesting STA. The BC
subphase shall not occur if the peer STA does not grant the request.
A DMG STA indicates that beam refinement transactions (9.35.6.4.2) occur by setting the L-RX field to a
value greater than 0 to indicate the need for receive beam refinement or by setting the value of the TX-TRN-
REQ field to 1 to indicate the need for transmit beam refinement or by setting both. The beam refinement
transactions shall occur if at least one of these conditions is met.

 If the initiator has requested an MID subphase by setting the MID-REQ subfield or the BC-REQ subfield to
 1 and the responder rejected by setting in the response the MID-Grant subfield or the BC-Grant subfield to
 0, respectively, the initiator should send a BRP frame with the MID-REQ field set to 0 and the L-RX field
 set to indicate the number of TRN-R fields the initiator requests for use in the BRP transaction.
 If the responder has requested an MID subphase by setting the MID-REQ subfield or the BC-REQ subfield
 to 1 and the initiator rejected by setting in the response the MID-Grant or the BC-Grant subfields to 0, the
 initiator should send a BRP frame with the Capability Request subfield set to 1. The responder shall respond
 with a BRP frame with the MID-REQ field set to 0 and the L-RX field set to indicate the number of TRN-R
 fields the responder requests for use in the BRP transaction.
 Beam refinement transactions shall occur following a MIDC subphase when one or both of the following
 conditions are met at the last BRP frame transmitted by either the initiator or responder as part of the MID or
 BC subphases:
    a)    Either the initiator or the responder set the L-RX field to a value greater than 0.
    b)    Either the initiator or responder has set the value of the TX-TRN-REQ field to 1.
 If within the appropriate IFS the initiator does not receive a response from the responder to a packet
 transmitted to the responder, the initiator may retransmit the packet.
 After the BRP setup subphase, beamforming training shall immediately continue to the next phase (i.e.,
 either MIDC subphase or the beam refinement transactions). Examples of BRP setup subphase procedures
 are illustrated in Figure 9-54, Figure 9-55, Figure 9-59, Figure 9-60, and Figure 9-66.

9.35.4 Beamforming in BTI
In the BTI, the PCP/AP performs an initiator TXSS as the first part of the SLS with the transmission of at
least one DMG Beacon frame. The PCP/AP does not transmit SSW frames in the BTI (9.35.2.2.1).
The PCP/AP may fragment the initiator TXSS over multiple consecutive BTIs by not transmitting a DMG
Beacon frame through all sectors available to the PCP/AP in a single BTI. In a BTI with a fragmented
initiator TXSS, the PCP/AP shall transmit DMG Beacon frames with the Fragmented TXSS field set to 1.
Otherwise, the PCP/AP shall set the Fragmented TXSS field to zero. The PCP/AP shall not change the
duration of the next BTI if at least one of the DMG Beacon frames transmitted in the current BTI have the
Fragmented TXSS field set to 1. The CDOWN field shall be set to the total number of transmissions
remaining to the end of the initiator TXSS, such that the last DMG Beacon frame transmission of the
initiator TXSS has the CDOWN field set to 0 (i.e., in a fragmented TXSS, the value of the CDOWN field
covers the total number of transmissions remaining in the fragmented TXSS). The TXSS Span field shall be
set to the total number of beacon intervals it takes the PCP/AP to complete the entire TXSS phase. The
Duration field within each transmitted DMG Beacon shall be set to the time remaining until the end of the
current BTI.
When a PCP/AP has more than one DMG antenna, the TXSS shall cover all the sectors in all DMG
antennas. The TXSS Span field indicates the total number of beacon intervals it takes the PCP/AP to cover
all sectors in all DMG antennas. The value of the TXSS Span field shall be lower than
dot11MaximalSectorScan. The PCP/AP shall not change DMG antennas within a BTI. The PCP/AP has a
regular schedule of transmitting through each DMG antenna (see 9.35.5.4).
NOTE—If an unassociated responder receives a DMG Beacon frame in the BTI with a fragmented initiator TXSS, the
responder may start a responder TXSS in the following A-BFT, or it may scan for the number of beacon intervals
indicated in a received TXSS Span field in order to cover a complete initiator TXSS and find a suitable TX sector from
the PCP/AP.
From start until the completion of a TXSS phase, all DMG Beacon frames transmitted by the PCP/AP shall
have the same value for all the subfields within the Beacon Interval Control field and DMG Parameters
field.

 9.35.5 Beamforming in A-BFT
 9.35.5.1 Allocation of A-BFT
 The PCP/AP shall allocate an A-BFT period MBIFS time following the end of a BTI that included a DMG
 Beacon frame transmission with Next A-BFT equal to 0.
 Following the end of a BTI, the PCP/AP shall decrement the value of the Next A-BFT field by one provided
 it is not equal to zero and shall announce this value in the next BTI. When the Next A-BFT field in a
 transmitted DMG Beacon is equal to 0, the value of the A-BFT Length field is no less than
 aMinSSSlotsPerABFT as described in 9.35.5.2. The PCP/AP may increase the Next A-BFT field value
 following a BTI in which the Next A-BFT field was equal to zero. A STA shall consider that a BTI is
 completed at the expiration of the value within the Duration field of the last DMG Beacon frame received in
 that BTI.
 All DMG Beacon frames transmitted within the number of beacon intervals specified within the most
 recently updated TXSS Span field have the same value for all the subfields within the Beacon Interval
 Control field (10.1.3.2a).
 9.35.5.2 Operation during the A-BFT
 Beamforming training in the A-BFT consists of the RSS and SSW Feedback of the SLS between the PCP/
 AP and a STA.
 In the A-BFT, the PCP/AP is the initiator and the STA is the responder in the RSS part of the SLS (9.35.2.3).
 The BRP phase shall not be performed within the A-BFT. A STA shall not transmit in the A-BFT of a
 beacon interval if it does not receive at least one DMG Beacon frame during the BTI of that beacon interval.
 A DMG STA that receives a DMG Beacon frame with the Discovery Mode field equal to 1 and the CC
 Present field equal to 1 may transmit in the A-BFT following the BTI where the DMG Beacon frame is
 received if at least one of the following conditions is met:
    —     The STA’s MAC address is equal to the value of the A-BFT Responder Address subfield within the
          DMG Beacon.
    —     The value of the A-BFT Responder Address subfield within the DMG Beacon is a group address of
          a group to which the STA belongs.
 If none of these conditions is met following the reception of the DMG Beacon frame with the Discovery
 Mode field equal to 1 and the CC Present field equal to 1, the DMG STA shall not transmit in the A-BFT.
 The A-BFT is slotted and the length of the A-BFT is an integral multiple of the sector sweep slot time. The
 structure of the A-BFT is shown in Figure 9-56. The PCP/AP shall announce the size of the A-BFT in the A-
 BFT Length subfield of the Beacon Interval Control field (8.3.4.1), which shall be no less than
 aMinSSSlotsPerABFT sector sweep (SSW) slots. The first SSW slot begins at the start of the A-BFT, and
 the following SSW slots are adjacent and nonoverlapping. An SSW slot (Figure 9-57) is a period of time
 within the A-BFT that can be used by a responder to transmit at least one SSW frame. An SSW slot has a
 duration of aSSSlotTime. aSSSlotTime is defined to be
    aSSSlotTime = aAirPropagationTime + aSSDuration + MBIFS + aSSFBDuration + MBIFS
 The parameter aAirPropagationTime accounts for the propagation delay between the initiator and the
 responder. The parameter aSSDuration (10.38) provides time for a responder to transmit up to the number of

If the IsResponderTXSS subfield of the Beacon Interval Control field is equal to 1, the A-BFT shall be used
to perform a responder TXSS. Otherwise, the A-BFT shall be used to perform a responder RXSS. In the case

 selecting a backoff count as a random integer drawn from a uniform distribution [0, A-BFT Length), i.e., 0
 to A-BFT Length – 1, where A-BFT Length is the value of the A-BFT Length field in the last received DMG
 Beacon. The responder shall decrement the backoff count by one at the end of each SSW slot, even if the CS
 function at the responder indicates the medium busy condition for that SSW slot. The responder may initiate
 the RSS only at the start of the SSW slot for which the backoff count is 0 at the beginning of the SSW slot.
 The responder shall transmit no more SSW frames within an SSW slot than indicated in the value of the FSS
 subfield in the DMG Beacon. If the responder has more SSW frames to transmit as part of the RSS, but is
 not allowed to send any more SSW frames in the current SSW slot, then the responder may resume the RSS
 at the start of the following SSW slot provided that the A-BFT has not ended. If the responder cannot
 complete the RSS before the end of the A-BFT, it may use the same backoff procedure described above to
 resume the RSS at the next A-BFT for which the value of the IsResponderTXSS field is the same as the
 current A-BFT.
 The initiator shall initiate an SSW Feedback to a responder (9.35.2.4) at a time such that the beginning of the
 first symbol of the SSW-Feedback frame on the air occurs at aSSFBDuration + MBIFS before the end of the
 SSW slot. A responder that transmitted at least one SSW frame within a SSW slot shall be in quasi-omni
 receive mode for a period of aSSFBDuration ending MBIFS time before the end of the SSW slot. The
 initiator may initiate an SSW Feedback to the responder at an SSW slot even if the responder did not
 complete RSS within that SSW slot. If the initiator transmits an SSW-Feedback under this circumstance, it
 can transmit an Announce frame to the responder in an ATI. Following the reception of the Announce
 frame, the responder can respond with an SPR frame requesting time for the responder to continue with the
 RSS. Alternatively, the responder can transmit an SPR frame to the PCP/AP in accordance with the channel
 access rules.
 The information contained in an SSW-Feedback frame is based on the SSW frames received during the
 SSW slot in which the SSW-Feedback frame was transmitted. To communicate with each other following an
 SLS, an initiator and responder should use the information contained within the SSW-Feedback frame that
 had the highest value for the SNR Report field and was transmitted or received, respectively, as part of the
 most recent SLS between the initiator and responder.
 A responder that receives an SSW-Feedback frame from the initiator during an A-BFT that was allocated
 with a DMG Beacon frame with Discovery Mode equal to 1 should not attempt to access the following
 aMaxABFTAccessPeriod A-BFT allocations to redo beamforming with the initiator, unless in the BTI
 preceding the A-BFT the responder receives a DMG Beacon frame that has the Discovery Mode field equal
 to 1, the CC Present field equal to 1 and the value of the A-BFT Responder Address subfield equal to the
 responder’s MAC address. This allows other STAs the opportunity to successfully contend for A-BFT
 access and perform beamforming with the initiator.
 The responder may attempt to restart the RSS within the same A-BFT if it does not receive a SSW-Feedback
 frame from the initiator by the end of the SSW slot in which it completes the RSS. To do this, the responder
 shall invoke the random backoff procedure beginning at the start of the SSW slot following the completion
 of the RSS. The responder shall select a backoff count as a random integer drawn from a uniform
 distribution [0, A-BFT Length), i.e., 0 to A-BFT Length – 1, where A-BFT Length is the value of the A-BFT
 Length field in the last received DMG Beacon. The responder shall decrement the backoff count by one at
 the end of each SSW slot, even if the CS function at the responder indicates the medium busy condition for
 that SSW slot. The responder may restart the RSS at the start of the SSW slot for which the backoff count is
 0 at the beginning of the SSW slot provided the A-BFT still has SSW slots available.
 At the end of an A-BFT the responder shall cancel a backoff procedure that was started during the A-BFT,
 but has not been completed at the end of the A-BFT. As described above, the responder invokes a random
 backoff procedure at the start of each A-BFT.

Each STA maintains a counter, FailedRSSAttempts, of the consecutive number of times the STA initiates
RSS during A-BFTs but does not successfully receive an SSW-Feedback frame as a response. If
FailedRSSAttempts exceeds dot11RSSRetryLimit, the STA shall select a backoff count as a random integer
drawn from a uniform distribution [0, dot11RSSBackoff), i.e., 0 inclusive through dot11RSSBackoff
exclusive. The responder shall decrement the backoff count by one at the end of each A-BFT period in the
following beacon intervals. The responder may re-initiate RSS only during an A-BFT when the backoff
count becomes zero. The STA shall set FailedRSSAttempts to 0 upon successfully receiving an SSW-
Feedback frame during the A-BFT.
In an A-BFT, the responder shall not initiate SSW ACK (9.35.2.5) in response to the reception of a SSW-
Feedback frame from the initiator. The SSW ACK only occurs within the DTI of a beacon interval
(9.35.6.2).
If the PCP/AP receives an SSW frame from the responder during the RSS with the Poll Required field
within the SSW frame equal to 1 and the TDDTI field within the PCP/AP’s DMG Capabilities element is 1,
the PCP/AP shall allocate time for the responder and the PCP/AP to communicate during the ATI or within
an SP of the DTI of at least one of the following aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals beginning with the beacon
interval in which the SSW frame was received. This can be done through the Extended Schedule element or
the transmission of a Poll or Grant frame addressed to the responder, and the allocated time can be used for
at least one of association, authentication, and service period request.
After transmitting an SSW-Feedback frame to the responder, the initiator shall send a BRP frame with the
Capability Request subfield within the BRP Request field set to 1 and addressed to the responder. The BRP
frame shall be sent in one of the following aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals beginning with the beacon
interval in which the RSS phase with the responder was last completed. The BRP frame shall be transmitted
at MCS 0 using the sector identified by the Sector Select field received from the responder during the RSS.
In an ATI after the completion of the SSW Feedback, a responder should have its receive antenna
configured to a quasi-omni antenna pattern in the DMG antenna in which it received the best sector from the
initiator during the preceding ISS in order to receive an Announce, Grant, or BRP frame (with the Capability
Request subfield within the BRP Request field set to 1) from the initiator, while the initiator should
configure its transmit DMG antenna to the value of the Sector Select and the DMG Antenna Select fields
received from the responder during the preceding RSS. If the responder does not receive an Announce or
Grant frame from the initiator with the RA address equal to the responder’s MAC address until
aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals after the beacon interval in which the SLS phase with the initiator was last
attempted, it may retry BF with the initiator in the A-BFT.
Due to the multiple access nature of RSS in the A-BFT, the PCP/AP might not receive the best sector for
communication with the STA. The PCP/AP may schedule an SP to perform BF again with the STA to find
the best sector for communication with the STA.
9.35.5.3 STA Beamforming after A-BFT
The initiator shall either initiate BRP execution with the responder in the next CBAP or shall schedule time
in the DTI for BRP execution with the responder if the initiator needs BRP training or the responder
indicated a need for training (by setting any of the L-RX, TX-TRN-REQ, MID-REQ, or BC-REQ fields to a
nonzero value) as a response to an SSW-Feedback or BRP frame with Capability Request subfield within
the BRP Request field set to 1.
The responder may initiate BRP in a CBAP by sending a BRP frame with any of the training request fields
(i.e., L-RX, TX-TRN-REQ, MID-REQ, BC-REQ) set to 1.
To schedule time in the DTI for BRP execution with the responder, the initiator shall transmit a Grant frame
to the responder in one of the following aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals beginning with the beacon interval

 in which the SLS phase with the responder was last completed. In the Grant frame, the initiator shall set the
 RA field to the MAC address of the responder and the TA field to the MAC address of the initiator. In the
 Dynamic Allocation Info field of the Grant frame, the AllocationType field shall be set to indicate SP, the
 source AID field shall be set to the AID of the initiator, the destination AID field shall be set to the broadcast
 AID and the Allocation Duration field shall be set to the expected duration of the BRP phase.
 If the initiator receives at least one SSW frame from a responder within an A-BFT but did not transmit an
 SSW-Feedback frame to the responder within that A-BFT, the initiator may schedule time in the DTI for the
 responder to complete the RSS. To do that, the initiator shall transmit a Grant frame to the responder before
 the next A-BFT. In the Grant frame, the initiator shall set the RA field to the MAC address of the responder
 and the TA field to the MAC address of the initiator. In the Dynamic Allocation Info field of the Grant
 frame, the AllocationType field shall be set to indicate SP, the source AID field shall be set to the broadcast
 AID, the destination AID field shall be set to the AID of the initiator and the Allocation Duration field shall
 be set to cover for at least the remaining duration of the RSS.
 The initiator may transmit an Announce frame to the responder during the ATI to announce a CBAP
 allocation in the beacon interval. If the responder receives the Announce frame with a CBAP allocation, the
 responder may contend for a TXOP during a CBAP to perform the BRP execution with the initiator or
 continue the RSS with the initiator.
 Any Announce or Grant frames the initiator sends to a responder after initiating beamforming with the
 responder in the A-BFT but before beamforming with the responder is completed shall be transmitted at
 MCS 0 using the sector identified by the Sector Select field received from the responder in the RSS.
 The execution of the beamforming procedure in an allocation in the DTI is described in 9.35.6.
 9.35.5.4 Beamforming in A-BFT with multiple DMG antennas
 A PCP/AP shall receive through a quasi-omni antenna pattern from a single DMG antenna throughout an A-
 BFT unless RXSS is used in the A-BFT, in which case it switches through antenna patterns as described in
 9.35.5.2.
 A PCP/AP shall have an A-BFT every k beacon intervals, where k is the value indicated by the N BIs A-BFT
 subfield in the Beacon Interval Control field. In an A-BFT, the PCP/AP shall receive in a quasi-omni
 antenna pattern using the DMG antenna indicated by the value of the DMG Antenna ID subfield within the
 SSW field transmitted in the DMG Beacon. A PCP/AP with multiple DMG antennas has a regular schedule
 of receiving through each DMG antenna corresponding to the DMG antenna in which a DMG Beacon is
 transmitted through. The PCP/AP shall switch RX DMG antenna every l allocations, where l is the value of
 the N A-BFT in Ant subfield within the Beacon Interval Control field.
 In each DMG Beacon, the A-BFT Count subfield in the Beacon Interval Control field indicates the number
 of A-BFTs that have passed since the PCP/AP last switched RX DMG antennas.
 9.35.6 Beamforming in DTI
 9.35.6.1 General
 An initiator and responder may perform BF training in the DTI within an SP allocation or within a TXOP
 allocation.
 An initiator shall determine the capabilities of the responder prior to initiating BF training with the
 responder if the responder is associated. A STA may obtain the capabilities of other STAs through the
 Information Request and Information Response frames (10.29.1) or following a STA’s association with the

PBSS/infrastructure BSS. The initiator should use its own capabilities and the capabilities of the responder
to compute the required allocation size to perform BF training and BF training related timeouts.
An initiator may request the PCP/AP to schedule an SP to perform BF training with a responder by setting
the Beamforming Training subfield in the BF Control field of the DMG TSPEC element or SPR frame to 1.
The PCP/AP shall set the Beamforming Training subfield to 1 in the Allocation field of the Extended
Schedule element if the Beamforming Training subfield in the BF Control field of the DMG TSPEC element
or SPR frame that generated this Allocation field is equal to 1. The PCP/AP should set the Beamforming
Training subfield in an Allocation field of the Extended Schedule element to 0 if this subfield was equal to 1
when the allocation was last transmitted by the PCP/AP in an Extended Schedule element and if, since that
last transmission, the PCP/AP did not receive a DMG TSPEC element for this allocation with the
Beamforming Training subfield equal to 1.
9.35.6.2 SLS phase execution
For BF training in the DTI, both the initiator and responder shall use the SSW frame for the ISS and RSS.
The initiator shall begin an ISS (9.35.2.2) at the start of the allocation with an initiator TXSS, except when
the allocation is an SP and the IsInitiatorTXSS field for this SP is equal to 0 in which case the initiator shall
begin an ISS with an initiator RXSS.
If the initiator begins the SLS within a CBAP and the responder has more than one DMG antenna, the
initiator shall repeat its ISS k+1 times, where k is the value indicated by the responder in the last negotiated
Number of RX DMG Antennas field transmitted by the responder. Repetitions of the ISS are separated by an
interval equal to LBIFS. The value of the CDOWN field within SSW frames transmitted in the ISS indicates
the number of sectors until the end of transmissions from all of the initiator’s DMG antennas to all of the
responder’s DMG antennas.
The RSS is a TXSS unless the allocation is an SP and the IsResponderTXSS field for this SP is equal to 0 or
the allocation is a TXOP and the RXSS Length field within the SSW frame received by the responder during
the ISS and used to obtain the TXOP is equal to a nonzero value. The responder shall begin an RSS
(9.35.2.3) MBIFS time following the completion of an ISS, provided there is sufficient time in the allocation
for the responder to transmit an SSW frame and the responder received an SSW frame from the initiator
during the ISS.
The initiator may restart the ISS up to dot11BFRetryLimit times if it does not receive an SSW frame from
the responder in dot11BFTXSSTime time following the end of the ISS. The initiator shall restart the ISS
SIFS time following dot11BFTXSSTime time, provided there is sufficient time left in the allocation for the
initiator to transmit an SSW frame. If there is not sufficient time left in the allocation for the transmission of
an SSW frame, the initiator shall restart the ISS at the start of the following allocation between the initiator
and the responder.
The initiator shall begin an SSW Feedback (9.35.2.4) MBIFS time following the completion of an RSS,
provided the initiator received an SSW frame from the responder during the RSS and there is sufficient time
left in the allocation to complete the SSW Feedback followed by an SSW ACK (9.35.2.5) from the
responder in SIFS time. If there is not sufficient time left in the allocation for the completion of the SSW
Feedback and SSW ACK, the initiator shall begin the SSW Feedback at the start of the following allocation
between the initiator and the responder.
The responder shall begin an SSW ACK (9.35.2.5) to the initiator in MBIFS time following the reception of
a SSW-Feedback frame from the initiator.
The initiator may restart the SSW Feedback up to dot11BFRetryLimit times if it does not receive an SSW-
ACK frame from the responder in MBIFS time following the completion of the SSW Feedback. The

 allocation for the completion of the SSW Feedback and SSW ACK, the initiator shall restart the SSW
 Feedback at the start of the following allocation between the initiator and the responder.
 Once started, the initiator and responder shall complete the SLS phase before any additional frame exchange
 takes place between these STAs.
 9.35.6.3 MIDC (multiple sector ID capture) subphase
 9.35.6.3.1 General
 In practice, the quasi-omni RX antenna patterns used in the SLS phase might exhibit imperfections that lead
 to an incorrect choice of the best TX sector and consequently a sub-optimal starting point for beam
 refinement in the BRP phase. To remedy this, a multiple sector ID capture (MIDC) phase may be used.
 Instead of selecting the starting point for the beam refinement transactions (i.e., the best TX sector) based on
 information obtained with quasi-omni RX antenna patterns from the SLS phase, the MIDC subphase enables
 the use of additional information based on the trial of multiple TX and RX sectors.
 The MIDC subphase can be implemented in two ways. The first option is to conduct a trial between a small
 set of TX and RX AWV settings with wide (e.g., quasi-omni) antenna patterns. The second option is to carry
 out a trial between a small set of TX sectors and a set of RX AWV settings, chosen by the receiver in an
 implementation-dependent manner, that maximizes the probability of determining the RX AWVs that best
 match the chosen set of TX sectors. Note that this may involve using a set of RX AWVs that correspond to
 the “full set” of RX sectors (from the SLS phase). The set of TX sectors are chosen from a TX sector sweep
 with a quasi-omni RX antenna pattern. With either option, the end result from the MIDC subphase can be
 the better starting point TX and RX sector pair for further beam refinement.
 For the first option above, the MIDC subphase consists of a MID subphase and a BC subphase. This is
 further elaborated upon in 9.35.6.3.2, and a sample time allocation is illustrated in Figure 9-58. For the
 second option, the MIDC subphase consists only of a MID subphase. This is further elaborated upon in
 9.35.6.3.3, and a sample time allocation is illustrated in Figure 9-59.

Prior to the beginning of the MIDC subphase, a BRP setup subphase is carried out as specified in 9.35.3.2.
This subphase enables the two DMG STAs involved to negotiate whether and how the MIDC subphase is
carried out. Examples of how the MIDC subphase is set up, depending on whether beamforming is initiated
in the BTI and A-BFT or in the DTI, are illustrated in Figure 9-60 and Figure 9-61, respectively. Note that
the MIDC subphase is applicable only when both the initiator and the responder have the ability to switch
among their sectors.

 9.35.6.3.2 MIDC subphase with MID and BC subphases
 The MIDC subphase can be implemented such that small subsets of TX Sector IDs and RX AWVs are first
 chosen, followed by trials between these subsets to determine the optimal starting TX Sector ID and RX
 AWV pair. The set of TX sectors is chosen from an a priori TX sector sweep with a quasi-omni RX antenna
 pattern (in the SLS phase). To enable the selection of the RX sectors, and the subsequent trial between the
 TX and RX sectors, the MIDC subphase consists of an MID subphase and a BC (or beam combining)
 subphase. In the MID subphase, a wide TX beam (e.g., quasi-omni) is used while the receiver sweeps
 through its choice of AWV settings to determine the set of RX AWVs with the highest link quality. This is
 followed by the BC subphase, which involves testing the multiple RX AWVs together with multiple TX
 AWVs.
 This is conceptually illustrated in Figure 9-62. Note that the consecutive numbering of TX Sector IDs (e.g.,
 TX Sector ID1, TX Sector ID2, ...) or RX AWVs is just used for representation purposes. It is used to
 indicate the subset of TX Sector IDs without placing any restrictions on how these Sector IDs are selected
 (i.e., consecutive numbering of TX Sector IDs does not mean that the selected TX Sector IDs should be
 those that are consecutively numbered).

  a)    Setting up the MID and BC subphases: To request a MIDC subphase with the MID and the BC
        subphases, the initiator shall transmit an SSW-Feedback or BRP frame with the MID-REQ and the
        BC-REQ fields set to 1 in the BRP Request field. The responder may grant this request by setting the
        MID-Grant and the BC-Grant fields to 1 in the BRP Request field within the next SSW-ACK or
        BRP frame transmitted to the initiator. The R-MID and R-BC subphases are performed if the request
        is granted and are not performed otherwise.
        The responder shall transmit an SSW-ACK or BRP frame to request a MIDC subphase, with the I-
        MID and I-BC subphases. It shall do so by setting the MID-REQ and the BC-REQ fields to 1 in the
        BRP Request field within the transmitted frame. The initiator may grant this request by setting the
        MID-Grant and the BC-Grant fields to 1 in the BRP Request field within the next BRP frame
        transmitted to the responder. The I-MID and I-BC subphases are performed if the request is granted
        and are not performed otherwise.
        If all of R-MID, R-BC, I-MID, and I-BC subphases are performed, the MID subphases are
        performed before the BC subphases. Within the MID subphase, R-MID is performed before I-MID.
        Within the BC subphase, R-BC is performed before I-BC (see Figure 9-58 and Figure 9-59).
        In addition to the MID-REQ, BC-REQ, MID-Grant and BC-Grant fields, the responder (and/or
        initiator) needs to obtain the number of RX AWV settings to be appended to BRP-RX packets in the
        R/I-MID subphase. To do this, the initiator (and/or responder) should use the L-RX field in the BRP
        Request field to convey this information. Similarly, the responder (and/or initiator) needs to obtain
        the IDs and SNRs of the TX sectors received during the SLS phase for use in the R-BC and I-BC
        subphases. To do this, the responder (and/or initiator) shall send a BRP packet with the TXSS-
        FBCK-REQ subfield and SNR Requested subfield set to 1 in the FBCK-REQ field of the DMG
        Beam Refinement element. In response, the initiator (and/or responder) should send a BRP frame
        with both the SNR Present subfield and the Sector ID Order Present subfield set to 1. The Nmeas
        subfield in the FBCK-TYPE field is set to indicate the number of sectors received during the last
        SLS for which an SNR measurement is included. In the Channel Measurement field, the initiator (or
        responder) should set the SNR subfield to the SNRs corresponding to the TX sectors trialed during
        the SLS phase. In the Sector ID subfield, it should list the sector IDs of the received sectors. The
        responder (and/or initiator) should then use the SNR information, and any additional information
        such as angular separation between sectors, to determine the TX sectors for use in the BC subphase.
        The responder (or initiator) shall inform the initiator (or responder) of the number of TX sectors
        using the Nbeam subfield in the FBCK-TYPE field during the BRP setup subphase. After the R/I-
        MID subphases, the same field is used to exchange information about the number of RX AWVs to
        be trialed during the BC subphase.
  b)    Executing the MID subphase: If R-MID was requested and granted during the SLS and/or
        subsequent BRP setup subphase, then after the BRP setup subphase, the R-MID shall be initiated by
        the responder sending a BRP frame with TRN-R fields (as requested in the BRP setup subphase).
        This packet may be transmitted using a wide pattern, approaching an omni transmit pattern, or using
        a sector antenna pattern. The receiver may use the TRN-R fields for receiver training.
        If the MID Extension field in the packet is equal to 1, the responder shall transmit another BRP-RX
        packet, which may be transmitted using another transmit pattern. It may continue transmitting BRP-
        RX packets as long as the MID Extension field in all of them is equal to 1. The last BRP-RX packet
        transmitted by the responder shall have the MID Extension field set to 0.
        If the initiator does not receive a BRP-RX packet within BRPIFS after transmitting the last packet of
        the BRP setup subphase, it may retransmit the last packet of the BRP setup subphase.
        After the initiator receives a BRP-RX packet with the MID Extension field set to 0, it shall respond
        with a BRP frame with the appropriate feedback. This BRP frame should be sent using the best TX
        sector as determined in the SLS phase, while the responder should use a quasi-omni pattern to
        receive this frame. The feedback included in this BRP frame is the number of RX AWVs to be tested
        in the subsequent R-BC subphase using the Nbeam subfield in the FBCK-TYPE field.

Std 802.11ad-2012                               LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
         If I-MID was granted in addition to R-MID, the initiator shall send a BRP frame with TRN-R fields
         (as requested in the BRP setup subphase). The initiator shall continue to send BRP packets if the
         MID Extension was set to 1 as in the R-MID.
         After the responder receives a BRP-RX packet with the MID Extension set to 0, it shall respond by
         sending a BRP frame with feedback. This BRP frame should be sent using the best TX sector as
         determined in the SLS phase, while the initiator should use a quasi-omni pattern to receive this
         frame. The feedback included in this BRP frame is the number of RX AWVs to be tested in the
         subsequent I-BC subphase using the Nbeam subfield in the FBCK-TYPE field. The initiator shall
         respond with a BRP frame with the TX-TRN-OK field set to 1 as an acknowledgment. The R-BC
         subphase then follows.
         If I-MID does not follow R-MID, the BC subphase follows immediately.
   c)    Executing the BC subphase: The execution of an I-BC subphase is used as an example. In an I-BC
         subphase, the initiator shall transmit Nbeam(I,TX) BRP-RX frames using the number of TX sectors
         specified during the BRP setup subphase. Each BRP-RX frame shall be appended with Nbeam(I,RX)
         TRN-R subfields, and shall include the Sector ID subfield of the TX sector used. While receiving
         these TRN-R subfields, the responder shall switch through the RX AWVs selected during the prior I-
         MID subphase. To conclude the I-BC subphase, the responder shall feed back to the initiator a BRP
         frame with (a) the BS-FBCK field set to the TX sector ID of the BRP-RX packet received with the
         highest link quality, and (b) the ordered list of transmit sectors (based on received link quality during
         the I-BC) using the Sector ID Order subfield in the Channel Measurement Feedback element. This
         BRP frame should be sent using the best TX sector as determined in the SLS phase, while the
         initiator should use a quasi-omni pattern to receive this frame. The complete procedure is illustrated
         in Figure 9-63, while Figure 9-64 depicts the beam combining subphase.

 9.35.6.3.3 MIDC subphase with MID subphase only
 The MIDC subphase may also be implemented such that multiple TX sectors, obtained from the TXSS in
 the SLS phase, are used instead of wide TX beams. Here, the receiver employs multiple RX AWVs for each
 TX sector chosen by the transmitter. Based on this joint trial of TX and RX AWVs, the optimal starting TX
 and RX AWV pair is chosen for further refinement in the BRP phase. In this case, the MIDC subphase
 consists only of the MID subphase. This is conceptually illustrated in Figure 9-65.

  a)      Setting up the MID subphase: The procedure of setting up the MID-subphase is described in
          9.35.3.2.
          In the example of Figure 9-66, the initiator transmits an SSW-Feedback with the MID-REQ subfield
          set to 1 and the BC-REQ subfield set to 0 in the BRP Request field, thus requesting an MIDC with
          only the R-MID subphase. The responder grants the MID-REQ by setting the MID-Grant subfield to
          1 in the SSW-ACK frame. The initiator then sends a frame with the SNR Present and Sector ID
          Order Present subfields both set to 1, the Nmeas subfield in the FBCK-TYPE field indicating the
          number of SNR measurements from the last SLS phase, and the SNR and Sector ID subfields with
          the SNRs measured during the SLS phase and the list of received sectors, respectively. The L-RX
          subfield is set according to the number of training fields the initiator needs in each packet as part of
          the R-MID. The responder then starts the R-MID process by transmitting BRP-RX packets.

  b)      Executing the MID subphase: The execution of the MID subphase for the responder link (i.e., R-
          MID) is used as an example. Execution of the MID subphase for the initiator link (i.e., I-MID) is
          similar, except for a change in the direction of the corresponding frames. In an R-MID subphase, the
          responder shall transmit one BRP-RX packet each from one of the chosen TX sectors. In each
          packet, it shall indicate the sector ID of the TX sector used using the Sector ID field in the BRP
          Request field. Each transmitted BRP-RX packet should be appended with multiple TRN-R subfields
          such that the initiator can train its receiver antenna during the R-MID subphase. The initiator shall
          train its receiver antenna by cycling through its choice of RX AWVs while receiving the TRN-R
          subfields. The initiator shall indicate to the responder the number of TRN-R subfields to be
          appended using the L-RX field in the BRP request field during the SLS phase or the BRP setup
          phase. For all BRP-RX packets except the last one, the responder shall also set the MID Extension
          field to 1.
          In the R-MID subphase, the initiator shall send a BRP frame with feedback. This BRP frame should
          be sent using the best TX sector as determined in the SLS phase, while the responder should use a
          quasi-omni pattern to receive this frame. The feedback included in this BRP frame should be (a) the
          BS-FBCK field set to the TX sector ID of the BRP-RX packet received with the highest link quality,
          and (b) the ordered list of transmit sectors (based on received link quality during the R-MID) using
          the Sector ID Order subfield.

 9.35.6.3.4 MIDC subphase with BC subphase only
 An MIDC subphase with only the BC subphase is carried out when the MID and BC subphases have been
 carried out earlier. In this case, the initiator and responder keep track of the TX and RX sectors, for use in
 the BC subphase, from earlier iterations. Since the best TX and RX sectors (in terms of link quality) are kept
 track of, this information can be used to deal with link blockage events. STAs can utilize only the chosen set
 of TX sectors in the SLS phase to reduce beamforming training time, and jump to the BC subphase directly
 without executing the MID subphase. In this manner, fast recovery is possible when some of backup links
 are available after partial blockage around the STA.
 To carry out the MIDC subphase with the BC subphase only, the MID-REQ field is set to 0 and the BC-REQ
 field is set to 1 in SSW-Feedback or SSW-ACK or BRP frames, and the BC-Grant field is set to 1 in the
 following SSW-ACK or BRP frame. The BC subphase can include an I-BC and/or an R-BC (9.35.6.3.2).
 9.35.6.4 BRP phase execution
 9.35.6.4.1 General
 Beam refinement is a request/response based process. A STA requests receive beam refinement training by
 sending a BRP frame with a nonzero value in the L-RX field. The STA that receives a BRP frame shall
 respond with a BRP packet (21.10.2.2) including as many TRN-R fields as indicated in the value of the L-
 RX field within the received BRP frame and with the RX-train-response field in the DMG Beam Refinement
 element set to 1.
 A STA requests transmit beam refinement training by sending a BRP frame as follows. In the BRP Request
 field, the TX-TRN-REQ field is set to 1, and the FBCK-REQ field is set to the desired feedback type. In the
 PLCP header, the Packet Type and the Training Length fields are set to indicate the number of AGC and
 TRN-T fields appended to the packet.
 The responding STA shall reply to the transmit beam refinement training with a BRP frame containing a
 DMG Beam Refinement element with the TX-TRN-OK field and TX-train-response field both set to 1 and
 the BS-FBCK field set to indicate the TRN-T field on which the responding STA received the best signal
 (the determination of best signal is implementation dependent). The FBCK-TYPE field shall be set to
 according to the format of the Channel Measurement Feedback element, if one is included in the frame. If
 the SNR Present and Channel Measurement Present subfields of this FBCK-TYPE field are set to 0, the
 Channel Measurement Feedback element shall not be included. The number of taps indicated in the FBCK-
 TYPE field shall be less than or equal to the number of taps indicated in the FBCK-REQ field of the request
 frame.
 If a STA requests transmit beam refinement training, but does not send TRN-T fields, the responding STA
 shall reply with a BRP frame containing a DMG Beam Refinement element with the TX-TRN-OK field set
 to 1. In this case (i.e., when the TX-train-response field is equal to 0), the responding STA shall set L-RX
 field to 0. The requesting STA shall then transmit a BRP packet with TRN-T fields. The responding STA
 shall then respond with a BRP frame with the TX-train-response field set to 1 and the BS-FBCK and
 Channel Measurement Feedback element as above.
 Beam refinement can start immediately following SLS (9.35.6.4.3). If the responder receives an SSW-
 Feedback frame from the PCP/AP in an A-BFT, the PCP/AP allocates an SP for the beam refinement if
 required (see 9.35.5.3). A STA may transmit a BRP packet to another STA whenever the STA transmits a
 frame to that STA, provided that the transmitting STA knows that the recipient STA’s receive antennas are
 directed to it or are in a quasi-omni antenna pattern.

A STA shall set the Initiator field to 1 within a DMG Beam Refinement element if the previous received
frame was not a BRP frame, or the last packet the STA transmitted was a BRP frame with the Initiator field
set to 1.
A STA that has transmitted a BRP frame with the Initiator field set to 1 and has not received a response
BRPIFS after the transmission may retransmit the frame.
A STA may request a TXSS sector list feedback by sending a BRP frame with the TXSS-FBCK-REQ field
set to 1, the SNR Requested subfield within the FBCK-REQ field set to 1 and the remaining subfields within
the FBCK-REQ field set to 0. The responding STA shall respond with a BRP frame with the SNR Requested
subfield within the FBCK-REQ field set to 1, with the remaining subfields within the FBCK-REQ field set
to 0, with a list of Sector IDs indicating the sector IDs of the received SSW frames or DMG Beacon frames,
and with the SNR values with which those frames were received in the last TXSS.
A STA shall not set the TXSS-FBCK-REQ and the TX-TRN-REQ fields to 1 in the same BRP frame.
Two or more BRP frames shall not be aggregated in the same A-MPDU. A BRP frame may be aggregated
with another frame in the same A-MPDU only if the other frame is a single ACK, BA or QoS-Null data
frame.
The Duration field within each BRP frame is set to the time remaining until the end of the current allocation.
9.35.6.4.2 Beam refinement transaction
A beam refinement transaction is a set of BRP frames composed of request and responses.
A beam refinement transaction starts with the beamforming initiator STA sending a BRP frame with the
Initiator field set to 1.
A beam refinement responder is a STA that receives a BRP frame (which is directed to it) with the Initiator
field set to 1.
A beam refinement transaction participant shall respond to a BRP frame with a BRP frame.
If the beam refinement transaction initiator received a BRP frame from the responder with no training
requests, the initiator may terminate the transaction by not transmitting any further BRP packets.
Figure 9-67, Figure 9-68, and Figure 9-69 show examples of beam refinement transactions.
9.35.6.4.3 Beam refinement transaction after SLS
If either L-RX or TX-TRN-REQ is nonzero within the BRP Request field in the SSW-ACK frame of the
most recent SLS phase execution, no MID or BC was granted during the BRP setup subphase, and no beam
refinement transaction has been done since the most recent SLS phase execution, then the initiator shall
initiate the beam refinement transaction with the responder by sending a BRP frame to the responder. If the
value of the L-RX field is greater than 0 in the SSW-ACK frame, the first BRP frame the initiator transmits
to the responder is a BRP-RX frame. If the value of the L-RX field is 0 and the value of the TX-TRN-REQ
field is 1, the first BRP frame the initiator transmits to the responder shall have either the TX-TRN-OK field
set to 1 or the L-RX field greater than 0.

 9.35.6.4.4 Antenna configuration setting during a beam refinement transaction
 A STA that has requested beam refinement receive training shall, except when receiving TRN-R fields, set
 its receive antenna configuration to the best known receive antenna configuration based on previous beam
 refinement receive training or RXSS. If the STA has not received a BRP frame since the last SLS and the
 SLS did not include an RXSS, the STA should set its receive antenna configuration to a quasi-omni antenna
 pattern in the DMG antenna through which the STA received the best sector during the SLS.
 A STA that has received a beam refinement transmit training request shall send the response frame and then

 refinement receive training or RXSS, except if both the initiator STA and responder STA support the
 Other_AID subfield as indicated through the Supports Other_AID field set to 1 within the STA’s DMG
 Capabilities element and the value of the Other_AID subfield within the BRP Request field is different from
 0, in which case the STA sets its antenna configuration to the best known receive antenna configuration for
 receiving from the STA with AID equal to the value of the Other_AID subfield within the BRP Request
 field. If the STA has not received a BRP frame since the last SLS and the SLS did not include an RXSS, the
 STA should set its antennas to a quasi-omni antenna pattern.
 In a BRP-RX packet, all TRN-R fields shall be transmitted using the same TX AWV configuration as the
 preamble and data fields of the packet, except if both the transmitting and receiving STAs support the
 Other_AID subfield as indicated through the Supports Other_AID field set to 1 within the STA’s DMG
 Capabilities element and the value of the Other_AID subfield within the BRP Request field is different from
 0, in which case the TRN-R fields shall be transmitted using the best known TX AWV configuration for
 transmitting to the STA with AID equal to the value of the Other_AID subfield within the BRP Request
 field.

9.35.7 Beam tracking
A STA (beam tracking initiator) may request a peer STA (beam tracking responder) to perform receive
beam tracking by setting, in a transmitted packet, the TXVECTOR parameter
BEAM_TRACKING_REQUEST to Beam Tracking Requested, TRN-LEN to the number of requested TRN
fields as described in 21.10.2.2.3 and packet type to TRN-R-PACKET. Otherwise, the
BEAM_TRACKING_REQUEST parameter shall be set to Beam Tracking Not Requested.
A beam tracking responder that receives a packet with the Beam Tracking Request field in the PLCP header
equal to 1 (corresponding to the BEAM_TRACKING_REQUEST parameter in the RXVECTOR set to
Beam Track Requested) and the Packet Type field in the PLCP header equal to 0 (corresponding to
PACKET-TYPE field in the RXVECTOR set to TRN-R-PACKET) shall follow the rules described in
21.10.2.2 and shall include a beam refinement AGC field and TRN-R subfields appended to the following
packet transmitted to the initiator. The value of TRN-LEN in the following packet from the responder to the
initiator shall be equal to the value of the TRN-LEN parameter in the RXVECTOR of the packet from the
initiator.
A beam tracking initiator requesting transmit beam tracking shall set the BEAM_TRACKING_REQUEST
parameter in the TXVECTOR to Beam Tracking Requested, Packet Type to TRN-T-PACKET, TRN-LEN
to the number of TRN fields as described in 21.10.2.2.3, and append an AGC field and TRN-T subfields to
the packet. The beam tracking responder may append the feedback to any packet from the responder to the
initiator. The initiator may allocate time for the feedback through a reverse direction grant, provided the
reverse direction protocol is supported by both the initiator and responder. The feedback type shall be the
same as the feedback type in the last BRP frame that was transmitted from the initiator to the responder with
TX-TRN-REQ equal to 1. If the responder has never received a BRP frame from the initiator with TX-TRN-
REQ equal to 1, the responder shall respond with all subfields of the FBCK-TYPE field equal to 0 and set
the BS-FBCK field to the best sector.
A beam tracking initiator may also request a beam tracking responder to perform receive beam tracking by
setting, in the PLCP header of a transmitted packet, the Beam Tracking Request field to 0, the Training
Length field to a nonzero value, the Packet Type field to 0, and append an AGC field and TRN-R subfields
to the transmitted packet.

 A beam tracking responder that receives a packet with the Beam Tracking Request field in the PLCP header
 equal to 0, the Training Length field in the PLCP header equal to a nonzero value and the Packet Type field

 AGC field and TRN-R subfields appended to the received packet to perform receive beam training.
 BRP frames transmitted during beam tracking may be aggregated within A-MPDUs. Figure 9-70 illustrates
 a beam tracking frame exchange sequence when the beam tracking initiator requests TRN-R fields, while
 Figure 9-71 illustrates a beam tracking frame exchange sequence when the beam tracking initiator requests

 9.36 DMG Block Ack with flow control
 9.36.1 General
 A DMG STA indicates that it is capable of supporting DMG Block Ack with flow control by setting the BA
 with Flow Control field to 1 within the DMG STA’s DMG Capabilities element. A DMG BlockAck with
 flow control can be established only when both originator and recipient support this capability.
 9.36.2 DMG Block Ack architecture with flow control
 The DMG Block Ack rules are explained in terms of the architecture shown in Figure 9-74 and explained in
 this subclause.
 The originator contains a Transmit Buffer Control that uses WinStartO, BufSizeO, and WinLimitO to submit
 MPDUs for transmission, and releases transmit buffers upon receiving BlockAck frames from the recipient
 or when it advances the transmit control buffer window.
 WinStartO is the starting sequence number of the transmit range, WinLimitO is the last sequence number
 expected to exhaust the receiver buffer capacity, and BufSizeO is the number of buffers negotiated in the
 Block Ack agreement.
 Figure 9-75 shows the DMG Block Ack with flow control and its associated parameters from the Originator
 perspective.

The Aggregation control creates A-MPDUs. It can adjust the Ack Policy field of transmitted data frames
according to the rules defined in 9.21.7.7 in order to solicit Block Ack responses.
The recipient contains a Receive Reordering Buffer Control per TA/TID, which contains related control
state.
The receive reordering buffer is responsible for reordering MSDUs or A-MSDUs so that MSDUs or A-
MSDUs are eventually passed up to the next MAC process in order of received sequence number (SN). It
maintains its own state independent of the Scoreboard Context Control to perform this reordering as
specified in 9.21.7.6. The delivery of in order MSDUs or A-MSDUs to the next MAC process is
implementation dependent. In some cases, the receiver reordering buffer might be forced to hold on to
MSDUs ready for in order delivery due to deferred reception at the next MAC process. This behavior can
impose additional buffering requirements on the receiver, causing the actual available buffer capacity to
vary dynamically. The reordering buffer is required to manage its lowest and highest (in order) SN, which
are marked as WinTailB and WinHeadB, respectively.
The scoreboard context control provides the WinCapacityB, actually controlled by the Reordering buffer in
addition to the bitmap field and the Starting Sequence Number (SSN) field to be sent in BlockAck responses
to the originator.

 The scoreboard context control with flow control is defined in 9.21.7.3 and 9.21.7.4.
 9.36.4 Receive Reordering Buffer with flow control operation
 9.36.4.1 General
 A recipient shall maintain a receive reordering buffer for each DMG Block Ack agreement. Each receive
 reordering buffer includes a record comprising the following:
    —     Buffered MSDUs or A-MSDUs that have been received, but not yet passed up to the next MAC
          process
    —     A WinStartB parameter, indicating the value of the Sequence Number field (SN) of the first (in order
          of ascending sequence number) MSDU or A-MSDU that has not yet been received
    —     A WinEndB parameter, indicating the highest SN expected to be received in the current reception
          range
    —     A BufSizeB parameter, indicating the size of the reception window
    —     A WinTailB parameter, indicating the value of the Sequence Number field (SN) of the first (in order
          of ascending sequence number) MSDU or A-MSDU that has not yet been delivered to the next
          MAC process
    —     A WinHeadB parameter, indicating the highest SN received in the current reception range
 WinStartB is initialized to the Starting Sequence Number field value (SSN) of the ADDBA request frame
 that elicited the ADDBA response frame that established the DMG Block Ack agreement.
 WinEndB is initialized to WinStartB + BufSizeB – 1, where BufSizeB is set to the value of the Buffer Size
 field of the ADDBA Response frame that established the Block Ack agreement.
 Both WinTailB and WinHeadB are initialized to the preceding Starting Sequence Number field value (SSN –
 1), to indicate no MPDU was received, within the current reception window.
 Any MSDU or A-MSDU that has been passed up to the next MAC process shall be deleted from the receive
 reordering buffer, advancing the WinTailB.
 The recipient shall pass MSDUs or A-MSDUs up to the next MAC process in order of increasing Sequence
 Number field value.
 9.36.4.2 Operation for DMG Block Ack agreement initialization
 At DMG Block Ack agreement establishment:
    a)    WinStartB = SSN from the ADDBA Request frame that elicited the ADDBA Response frame that
          established the DMG Block Ack agreement
    b)    WinEndB = WinStartB + BufSizeB – 1
    c)    WinCapacityB = BufSizeB
    d)    WinHeadB = SSN – 1, where SSN is taken from the ADDBA Request, similar to WinStartB
    e)    WinTailB = SSN – 1

9.36.4.3 Operation for each received data MPDU
For each received data MPDU that is related to a specific DMG Block Ack agreement, the receive
reordering buffer record is modified as follows, where SN is the value of the Sequence Number field of the
received MPDU:
   a)   If WinStartB <= SN <= WinEndB
        1)    Store the received MPDU in the buffer.
              i)   If SN > WinHeadB, Set WinHeadB = SN.
              ii)  If SN > (WinTailB + BufSizeB),
                   1)   All MSDU buffers with sequence numbers from WinTailB to SN – BufSizeB that
                        were received correctly are passed to the next MAC process.
                   2)   Set WinTailB = SN – BufSizeB.
              iii) Set WinCapacityB = WinTailB + BufSizeB – WinHeadB.
        2)    Set WinStartB to the value of the Sequence Number field of the first MSDU or A-MSDU that is
              missing to allow in-order delivery to the next MAC process.
        3)    Set WinEndB = WinStartB + BufSizeB – 1.
   b)   If WinEndB < SN < WinStartB + 211
        1)    Store the received MPDU in the buffer.
        2)    Set WinEndB = SN.
        3)    Set WinStartB = WinEndB – BufSizeB + 1.
        4)    All MSDU buffers with sequence numbers from WinTailB to SN – BufSizeB that were received
              correctly are passed to the next MAC process.
        5)    Set WinTailB = SN – BufSizeB.
        6)    Set WinHeadB = SN.
        7)    Set WinCapacityB = WinTailB + BufSizeB – WinHeadB.
   c)   If WinStartB + 211<= SN < WinStartB, discard the MPDU (do not store the MPDU in the buffer, do
        not pass the MSDU or A-MSDU up to the next MAC process).
   d)   For each received Block Ack Request frame the block acknowledgment record for that agreement is
        modified as follows, where SSN is the value from the Starting Sequence Number field of the
        received Block Ack Request frame:
        1)    If WinStartB < SSN <= WinEndB
              i)   Set WinStartB = SSN.
              ii)  Set WinEndB = WinStartB + BufSizeB – 1.
              iii) If SSN > WinHeadB, set WinHeadB = SSN – 1.
              iv) If SSN > (WinTailB + BufSizeB),
                   1)   All MSDU buffers with sequence numbers from WinTailB to SSN – BufSizeB, are
                        discarded from the buffer.
                   2)   Set WinTailB = SSN – BufSizeB.
              v)   Set WinCapacityB = WinTailB + BufSizeB – WinHeadB.
        2)    If WinEndB < SSN < WinStartB + 211
              i)   Set WinStartB = SSN.
              ii)  Set WinEndB = WinStartB + BufSizeB – 1.
              iii) Set WinHeadB = SSN – 1.
              iv) If SSN > (WinTailB + BufSizeB),

                    2)    Set WinTailB = SSN – BufSizeB.
               v)   Set WinCapacityB = WinTailB + BufSizeB – WinHeadB.
          3)   If WinStartB + 211 <= SSN <= WinStartB, make no changes to the record.
 9.36.4.4 Operation for ongoing release of received MPDUs
 The reordering buffer shall continue to pass MSDUs or A-MSDUs up to the next MAC process that are
 stored in the buffer in order of increasing value of the Sequence Number field, starting with the MSDU or A-
 MSDU that has SN = WinTailB and proceeding sequentially until there is no ready in-order MSDU or A-
 MSDU buffered for the next sequential value of the Sequence Number field.
    a)    Set WinTailB to the value of the Sequence Number field of the last MSDU or A-MSDU that was
          passed up to the next MAC process plus one.
 9.36.5 Generation and transmission of BlockAck by a STA with flow control
 In addition to the normative behavior specified in 9.21.7.5 when responding with a BlockAck frame, the
 RBUFCAP field shall be updated with the value of WinCapacityB.
 9.36.6 Originator’s behavior with flow control support
 If the BA with Flow Control field within a recipient’s DMG Capabilities element is equal to 1, the originator
 shall not transmit an MPDU with a SN that is beyond the current recipient’s buffer capacity (WinLimitO).
 The BlockAck frame indicates the number of free buffer slots available at the recipient for reception of
 additional MPDUs.
 The originator shall update the variable WinLimitO upon reception of a valid BlockAck:
    —     Set WinCapacityO to the received value of the RBUFCAP field in the BlockAck frame.
    —     Set MostSuccSN to the highest SN of positively acknowledged MPDUs
    —     Set WinLimitO = MostSuccSN + WinCapacityO
 NOTE—Updating the variable WinLimitO limits the transmission of the following MPDUs.
 Originator’s support of recipient’s partial state is defined in 9.21.7.9.
 9.37 DMG link adaptation
 9.37.1 General
 A STA may transmit a Link Measurement Request frame to request a STA indicated in the RA field of the
 frame to respond with a Link Measurement Report frame (8.5.7.5). If the Link Measurement Request frame
 is sent within a PPDU defined in Clause 21, the Link Measurement Report frame shall contain the DMG
 Link Margin element. The requesting STA may use values of the MCS, of the SNR and of the Link Margin
 to transmit frames to the STA indicated in the RA field of the Link Measurement Request frame.
 The requesting STA may aggregate a Link Measurement Request frame in an A-MPDU as defined in Table
 8-284 and Table 8-287.
 318                                                                       Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.
                                                                                                          IEEE

If the Dialog Token field in the Link Measurement Request frame is equal to a nonzero value, the
responding STA shall perform the measurement on the next frame received from the requesting STA and
shall send back a Link Measurement Report frame corresponding to the received frame.
The responding STA may aggregate a Link Measurement Report frame in a A-MPDU as defined in Table 8-
284 and Table 8-287.
A DMG STA with MAC address that is equal to the value of the Link Measurement Request frame RA field
shall transmit a Link Measurement Report frame addressed to the requesting STA. The RA field of the Link
Measurement Report frame shall be equal to the TA field of the Link Measurement Request frame.
If the Dialog Token field in the Link Measurement Report frame is equal to the nonzero Dialog Token field
of the Link Measurement Request frame, then the MCS, SNR, and Link Margin fields of the Link
Measurement Report frame shall be computed using the measurements of the PPDU that is the subsequent
frame following the Link Measurement Request frame.
If the Dialog Token field in the Link Measurement Request frame is equal to 0, the responding STA may set
the MCS field in the Link Measurement Report frame to the MCS value computed based on any of the
received frames from the requesting STA.
The SNR field and Link Margin field in the Link Measurement Report frame shall indicate the
corresponding measurements based on the reception of the PPDU that was used to generate the MCS
feedback contained in the same Link Measurement Report frame.
The Link Measurement Request and Report frames can be used to obtain Link Margin information, which
can be used to determine appropriate action by the requesting STA (e.g., change MCS or control transmit
power or initiate FST).
A STA may send an unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame with the Dialog Token field set to 0.
9.37.2 DMG TPC
A DMG STA that receives a Link Measurement Report frame containing a DMG Link Margin element that
indicates Increase or Decrease Transmit power behaves according to the following rules:
   —     If the DMG STA intends to implement the recommendation indicated in the Activity field of the
         Link Measurement Report, it shall implement the change and send a Link Measurement Report
         containing a DMG Link Adaptation Acknowledgment element not later than 2×aPPDUMaxTime
         after it acknowledged the reception of the Link Measurement Report. The Activity field of the DMG
         Link Adaptation Acknowledgment element shall be set to the value of the Activity field in the
         received DMG Link Margin Subelement.
   —     If the DMG STA does not implement the recommendation indicated in the Activity field of the Link
         Measurement Report, it may send the Link Measurement report containing a DMG Link Adaptation
         Acknowledgment element no later than 2×aPPDUMaxTime after it acknowledges the reception of
         the Link Measurement Report. The Activity field of the DMG Link Adaptation Acknowledgment
         element shall be set to 0, indication the STA prefers to not change transmit power.
A DMG STA shall not include the DMG Link Adaptation Acknowledgment element in a Link Measurement
Report unless it is in response to a Link Measurement Report with Activity field set to increase or decrease
transmit power.

 9.37.3 Fast link adaptation
 A STA supports fast link adaptation if the Fast Link Adaptation field in the STA’s DMG Capabilities
 element is 1. Otherwise, the STA does not support fast link adaptation. A STA that supports fast link
 adaptation shall not use fast link adaptation with a peer STA that does not support fast link adaptation.
 A STA that supports fast link adaptation shall support the reverse direction protocol (see 9.25). The STA
 that transmits a Link Measurement Request frame as part of fast link adaptation shall be the RD initiator and
 the STA that responds with a Link Measurement Report frame shall be the RD responder. Transmission of
 Link Measurement Request, Link Measurement Report and the frames defined below shall follow the rules
 of the reverse direction protocol.
 A STA initiates fast link adaptation by transmitting a Link Measurement Request frame of subtype Action
 No Ack and that has the Dialog Token field set to 0. The PPDU containing the frame shall have the
 AGGREGATION parameter in the TXVECTOR set to AGGREGATED, shall not contain any other frame
 that requires immediate response, and shall have a duration (as determined by the PHY-TXTIME.confirm
 primitive defined in 6.5.8) that is greater than 5.27 μs.
 NOTE—The PPDUs have the AGGREGATION parameter in the TXVECTOR set to AGGREGATED to allow padding
 of the PSDUs with MPDU delimiters of size 0, therefore meeting the transmission duration requirement.
 A STA supporting fast link adaptation and that receives a Link Measurement Request frame of subtype
 Action No Ack, with the Dialog Token field equal to 0 and contained in a PPDU with the AGGREGATION
 parameter in the RXVECTOR equal to AGGREGATED shall respond with a Link Measurement Report
 frame in no longer than BRPIFS from the reception of the Link Measurement Request frame. The TPC
 Report element, DMG Link Margin element and other fields transmitted in the Link Measurement Report
 frame shall reflect measurements on the PPDU that contained the last received Link Measurement Request
 frame from the initiating STA.
 The STA responding with the Link Measurement Report frame shall keep the IFS not longer than SIFS by
 transmitting PPDUs that do not contain frames requiring immediate response and that have a duration that is
 greater than 5.27 μs. All transmitted PPDUs should use the same MCS and the same transmit power.
 The transmitted Link Measurement Report frame shall be of subtype Action No Ack, shall be sent using
 MCS 1, and shall be sent within a PPDU with the AGGREGATION parameter in the TXVECTOR set to
 AGGREGATED. In addition, the PPDU shall not contain any frame that requires immediate response and
 shall have a duration that is greater than 5.27 μs.
 If at least one of the conditions above for the transmission of the Link Measurement Report frame is not met,
 the STA may follow the rules in 9.37.1 to respond to the received Link Measurement Request frame.
 A STA that supports fast link adaptation and that receives a Link Measurement Report frame should respond
 with an unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame in no longer than BRPIFS from the reception of the
 Link Measurement Report frame. The TPC Report element, DMG Link Margin element and other fields
 transmitted in the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame shall reflect measurements taken on one or
 more of the PPDUs received by the STA transmitting the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame,
 starting with the received Link Measurement Report frame itself. If the unsolicited Link Measurement
 Report frame is transmitted longer than SIFS from the reception of the Link Measurement Report frame, the
 STA transmitting the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame shall keep the IFS not longer than SIFS
 by transmitting one or more PPDUs before issuing the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame.
 An example of the fast link adaptation procedure is shown in Figure 9-76.

9.38 DMG dynamic tone pairing (DTP)
A pair of communicating STAs shall employ DTP modulation only if both STAs support DTP as indicated
through the DTP Supported field within the STA’s DMG Capabilities element.
A DTP capable STA may use DTP with another DTP capable STA by setting the DTP_TYPE in the
TXVECTOR to dynamic; otherwise, the DTP_TYPE is set to static. The transmitting STA may stop using
DTP by setting the DTP_TYPE in the TXVECTOR to static.
A transmitting STA requests a DTP report from a receiving STA by sending a DTP Request frame to that
STA. Upon receiving a DTP Request frame, the receiving STA shall respond with a DTP Report frame
carrying the DTP configuration. The DTP Report frame should be sent no later than dot11BeaconPeriod
TUs after the receiving STA transmits an ACK frame in response to the successful reception of the DTP
Request frame. If the transmitting STA does not receive a DTP Report frame from the receiving STA within
dot11BeaconPeriod TUs from the transmitting STA’s reception of the ACK frame corresponding to its most
recent DTP Request frame transmission to the receiving STA, the transmitting STA may retransmit the DTP
Request frame to the receiving STA. The Dialog Token field of the DTP Report frame is set to the Dialog
Token value in the corresponding DTP Request frame.
The transmitting STA should switch to the updated DTP configuration after a DTP Report frame is received.
If a STA transmits a DTP Report frame in response to the reception of a DTP Request frame, the STA shall
not send an updated DTP Report frame unless it receives another DTP Request frame.
If a STA transmits an unsolicited DTP Report frame, the STA should not send a new unsolicited updated
DTP Report unless the transmitting STA has switched to the DTP configuration last sent.
Both the transmitting and receiving STAs maintain two copies of DTP configurations: the current
configuration that is in use for transmission and an updated configuration, if any, received after the current
configuration. The transmitting STA determines when to switch from the current to the updated DTP
configuration. The transmitting STA shall indicate the switch from the current configuration to the updated
configuration by toggling the DTP Indicator bit field in the PLCP header. The value of the DTP Indicator
field shall be kept unchanged until the transmitting STA decides to switch to the new DTP configuration. By
receiving an ACK frame in response to a data frame from the receiving STA, the switching operation is
completed.
The transmitting STA may send another DTP Request frame to a receiving STA even if it decided not to
switch to the DTP configuration indicated by the receiving STA’s last transmitted, if any, DTP Report
frame.

 If the Beam link cluster field is 0, then the links within the MMSL cluster that use DTP may maintain
 independent DTP configurations.
 9.39 DMG relay operation
 9.39.1 General
 The DMG relay procedures are specified in 10.35. This subclause specifies the supported types of DMG
 relay.
 A source REDS, a destination REDS and an RDS can establish two types of relay operation:
    —     Link switching (9.39.2): If the direct link between the source REDS and destination REDS is
          disrupted, the source REDS redirects the transmission of frames addressed to the destination REDS
          via the RDS. The RDS forwards frames received from the source REDS to the destination REDS
          and from the destination REDS to the source REDS. Direct communication between the source
          REDS and destination REDS can resume after the direct link between them is recovered.
    —     Link cooperating (9.39.3): In this case, the RDS is actively involved in the direct communication
          between the source REDS and the destination REDS. A frame transmission from the source REDS
          to the destination REDS is simultaneously repeated by the RDS, which can possibly increase the
          signal quality received at the destination REDS.
 9.39.2 Link switching type
 9.39.2.1 General
 A source REDS that has successfully completed an RLS procedure with a destination REDS for which the
 value of the Cooperation-Mode subfield within the negotiated Relay Transfer Parameter Set element is 0
 may use the selected RDS between the source REDS and destination REDS for the purpose of link
 switching. This is described in this subclause.
 9.39.2.2 SP request and allocation
 The source REDS uses the procedures described in 10.4 to request an SP allocation between itself and the
 destination REDS.
 Upon receiving an ADDTS Request frame for which the source AID and the destination AID fields within
 the DMG TSPEC element are equal to a pair of a source REDS and a destination REDS, respectively, that
 have successfully completed the RLS procedure defined in 10.35.2.4, the PCP/AP schedules an SP with the
 source DMG STA as the source REDS and the destination DMG STA as the destination REDS.
 An RDS shall check the value of the source AID and the destination AID fields of each SP allocation within
 an Extended Schedule element it receives in a DMG Beacon or Announce frame from the PCP/AP. If the
 value of the source AID and the destination AID fields of an SP allocation correspond to a source REDS and
 a destination REDS, respectively, that have successfully completed the RLS setup procedure (10.35.2), the
 RDS shall operate as an RDS during that SP allocation.
 9.39.2.3 Usage of RDS
 In link switching type, an RDS operates either in FD-AF mode or in HD-DF mode. An RDS capable of FD-
 AF relaying shall be in one of two frame transmission modes:
 322                                                                   Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.
                                                                                                          IEEE
ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                     Std 802.11ad-2012
   —    Normal mode: A pair of source REDS and destination REDS exchange frames via either the direct
        link or the relay link until this link is determined to become unavailable due to, for example,
        blockage or channel degradation.
   —    Alternation mode: A source REDS and a destination REDS exchange frames via two separate
        links, where the use of each link alternates at each Link Change Interval. The Link Change Interval
        specifies the time instants at which a source REDS is allowed to change the link used for a frame
        transmission to the destination REDS as specified in 8.4.2.151.
An RDS that supports only HD-DF shall operate in the Normal mode.
The frame transmission mode is indicated in the Relay Transfer Parameter Set element exchanged by the
source REDS, destination REDS, and RDS during the RLS procedure. A source REDS or destination REDS
may change the transmission mode used in a relay link following a successful exchange of RLS Request and
RLS Response frames as described in 10.35.2.4.
An RDS shall start to operate as RDS at the start of an SP for which the value of the source AID and
destination AID fields for that SP are equal to the source REDS and destination REDS, respectively, for
which the RDS has successfully completed the RLS procedure. The RDS can determine the SPs for which it
operates as an RDS upon the reception of an Extended Schedule element.
9.39.2.4 Relay frame exchange rules
9.39.2.4.1 General
Following the completion of the RLS procedure and SP allocation, each of the source REDS, destination
REDS, and RDS have a direct link with one another.
The values of Link Change Interval and Data Sensing Time are indicated within the Relay Transfer
Parameter Set transmitted by the source REDS to the destination REDS during the RLS procedure. Either
the Link Change Interval period or the First Period begins at the start of an SP between the source REDS and
the destination REDS, and any transmission by the source REDS, destination REDS, and RDS within a Link
Change Interval period shall use the same link that is used at the start of the Link Change Interval period. A
new Link Change Interval period starts immediately after another Link Change Interval period, but shall not
exceed the end of the SP.
In the normal mode, a source REDS shall use the direct link to initiate frame transmission to the destination
REDS at the start of the first SP allocated between the source REDS and destination REDS for a particular
TID. At the start of the following SP allocations for that same TID, the source REDS uses the last link in
which a frame transmission to the destination REDS via this link was successful. In the alternation mode, the
source DMG STA shall alternate the frame transmission to the destination REDS between direct frame
transmission to the destination REDS and frame transmission through the RDS. The source REDS shall
alternate the link used for a frame transmission at the start of each Link Change Interval.
If a source REDS transmits a frame to the destination REDS via the direct link but does not receive an
expected ACK frame or BA frame from the destination REDS during a Link Change Interval period, the
source REDS should change the link used for frame transmission at the start of the following Link Change
Interval period and use the RDS to forward frames to the destination REDS.
If a source REDS transmits a frame to the destination REDS via the RDS but does not receive an expected
ACK frame or BA frame from the RDS during a Link Change Interval period or a First Period, the source
REDS should change the link used for frame transmission at the start of the following Link Change Interval
period or the following First Period and transmit frames directly to the destination REDS.

 9.39.2.4.2 Additional frame exchange rules for FD-AF RDS
 If the source REDS decides to change the link at the start of the following Link Change Interval period and
 the Normal mode is used, the source REDS shall start its frame transmission after Data Sensing Time from
 the start of the following Link Change Interval period. If the Alternation mode is used, the source REDS
 alternates the link used for frame transmission at the start of each Link Change Interval period, and the value
 of Data Sensing Time is ignored.
 In the Normal mode, if the destination REDS does not receive a valid frame from the source REDS within
 Data Sensing Time after the start of a Link Change Interval, the destination REDS shall immediately change
 the link to attempt to receive frames from the source REDS through the RDS. If the More Data field in the
 last frame received from the source REDS is equal to 0, then the destination REDS shall not switch to the
 link in the next Link Change Interval period even if it does not receive a frame during the Data Sensing
 Time. An example of frame transfer under Normal mode with FD-AF RDS is illustrated in Figure 9-77.

 In the Alternation mode, if the destination REDS receives an out of order frame, the destination REDS shall
 remain at the current link. If the More Data field in the last frame received from the source REDS is equal to
 0, then the destination REDS shall not switch links in the next Link Change Interval period. If the source
 REDS uses either the direct or the relay link and decides to resume alternate frame transmission, the source
 REDS should transmit a frame to the other link Data Sensing Time after the next Link Change Interval to
 inform the destination REDS that operation on the other link has been resumed. Note that this is the only
 situation when Data Sensing Time is used in the Alternation mode.
 9.39.2.4.3 Additional frame exchange rules for HD-DF RDS
 When the RDS is operating as a HD-DF RDS and the RDS is used in the frame exchange between the source
 REDS and the destination REDS, the frame exchange is performed in two periods, which are repeated for as
 long as the RDS is used. In the First Period, the source REDS shall transmit a frame to the RDS and then the
 RDS responds after SIFS if needed. In the Second Period, the RDS shall forward the frame received from
 the source REDS to the destination REDS, and then the destination REDS responds after SIFS if needed.
 The duration of the First Period and the Second Period are specified in the last Relay Transfer Parameter Set
 element transmitted from the source REDS.
 The First Period and Second Period are valid only when the source REDS and destination REDS exchange
 frames via the RDS. The Link Change Interval is valid only when the source REDS and destination REDS
 exchange frames via the direct link. The First Period begins at the end of the Link Change Interval when a
 324                                                                       Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

change to the relay link occurs. The Link Change Interval begins at the end of the Second Period when a
change to the direct link occurs.
The source REDS may transmit a Relay ACK Request frame to the RDS to determine whether all frames
forwarded through the RDS were successfully received by the destination REDS. Upon reception of a Relay
ACK Request frame, the RDS shall respond with a Relay ACK Response frame and set the BlockAck
Bitmap field to indicate which frames have been successfully received by the destination REDS.
If the source REDS decides to change to the relay link at the start of the following Link Change Interval
period, the source REDS shall start its frame transmission at the start of the following Link Change Interval
period. If the current link is the direct link and the destination REDS does not receive a valid frame from the
source REDS within Data Sensing Time after the start of each Link Change Interval, the destination REDS
shall change the link and consider the First Period to begin at the start of the Link Change Interval.
If a link change to the direct link occurs, the source REDS shall start to transmit a frame using the direct link
at the end of the Second Period when the Link Change Interval begins. The destination REDS shall switch to
the direct link at each First Period and listen to the medium toward the source REDS. If the destination
REDS receives a valid frame from the source REDS, the destination REDS shall remain on the direct link
and consider the Link Change Interval to begin at the start of the First Period. Otherwise, the destination
REDS shall change the link at the start of the next Second Period and attempt to receive frames from the
source REDS through the RDS. If the active link is the relay link and the More Data field in the last frame
received from the RDS is equal to 0, then the destination REDS shall not switch to the direct link even if it
does not receive any frame during the Second Period.
The source REDS that intends to use the Block Ack mechanism through the RDS shall perform the Block
Ack setup procedure with the RDS using the same TID as it is used for the direct communication between
the source REDS and the destination REDS. Similarly, the RDS shall perform the Block Ack setup
procedure with the destination REDS before transmitting data using the Block Ack mechanism. Upon
reception of an ADDBA Request frame from the source REDS, the RDS shall send an ADDBA Request
frame to the destination REDS with the same content for all corresponding fields as the ADDBA Request
frame received from the source REDS, except for Buffer Size field, which contains the buffer size of the
RDS. Following the reception of the ADDBA Response frame from the destination REDS, the RDS shall
send an ADDBA Response frame to the source REDS. The ADDBA Response frame shall have the same
content for all corresponding fields as the ADDBA Response frame received from the destination REDS,
except for the Buffer Size field, which shall be set to the minimum between the buffer size of the RDS and
the destination REDS.
An example of frame transfer with HD-DF RDS is illustrated in Figure 9-78.

 9.39.2.4.4 Operation of FD-AF RDS
 In an SP allocated for relay operation, a FD-AF RDS operates in an amplify-and-forward manner. This
 means that for each frame detected at the RF in the receive state within an SP in which it operates as a FD-
 AF RDS, the RDS amplifies the received signal and simultaneously retransmits it via the RF in transmit
 state.
 At the start of the SP where it operates as a FD-AF RDS, the RDS shall initiate an RF antenna module in the
 receive state directed toward the source REDS and another RF antenna module in transmit state directed
 toward the destination REDS.
 For each frame received at the RDS during the SP, the RDS shall follow the same rules for frame exchange
 sequences as described in Annex G and 9.33. This includes switching the state of each RF available to the
 RDS from receive to transmit, and vice-versa, depending upon the frame type and its ACK policy.
 9.39.2.5 Link monitoring
 After a link change, the source REDS might periodically monitor the quality of the previous link. To do that,
 the source REDS can use the link change mechanism described in 9.39.2.4. If the previous link is the relay
 link, the source REDS can acquire the channel status by using relay link measurement mechanism as
 described in 9.39.4. If the previous link is the direct link, the source REDS can acquire the channel status via
 the link adaptation mechanism defined in 9.37. If the channel quality of the previous link is better than the
 one on the current link, which is an implementation-dependent decision, the source REDS may switch to the
 previous link.
 9.39.3 Link cooperating type
 9.39.3.1 TPA procedure
 A source REDS, a destination REDS, and an RDS use the common relay setup procedure defined in 10.35.2
 to set up a link cooperating relay. In addition, to establish a link cooperating relay, the source REDS,
 destination REDS, and RDS shall perform the TPA procedure described in this subclause and shown in
 Figure 9-79.

The TPA procedure is triggered by the destination REDS following the common relay setup procedure with
the source REDS and RDS. First, the destination REDS uses the procedures described in 10.4 to request the
allocation of an SP to perform TPA, wherein the source of the SP is the destination REDS and the
destination of the SP is the source REDS. If the value of a source AID and the destination AID fields of an
SP allocation correspond to a destination REDS and a source REDS, respectively, that have successfully
completed the RLS setup procedure, the DMG STA that performs as an RDS in that SP allocation shall
operate during the allocation as a non-RDS-capable DMG STA.
Within the allocated SP, the destination REDS sends a TPA Request frame to the RDS and sets the Timing
Offset field to zero (see Figure 9-79). SBIFS interval following the end of the first TPA Request frame
transmission, the destination REDS shall send the second TPA Request frame to the source REDS and set
the Timing Offset field to zero. aDtime interval (10.38) following the reception of the first TPA Request
frame, the RDS shall transmit a TPA Response frame back to the destination REDS. Upon receiving the
TPA Response frame from the RDS, the destination REDS shall estimate the TPA value of the RDS and the
time deviation (i.e., 2×dTDR) between the expected Dtime and the actual arrival time of the TPA Response
frame. aDtime interval following the reception of the second TPA Request frame, the source REDS shall
transmit a TPA Response frame back to the destination REDS. The destination REDS shall repeat the same
procedure upon reception of the TPA Response frame received from the source REDS.
SBIFS interval following the end of the transmission of the TPA Response frame to the destination REDS,
the source REDS shall send a TPA Request frame to the RDS and set the Timing Offset field to zero. aDtime
interval following the reception of the TPA Request frame, the RDS shall transmit a TPA Response frame
back to the source REDS. Upon reception of the TPA Response frame from the RDS, the source REDS shall
estimate the TPA value of the RDS and the time deviation (i.e., 2×dTSR) between aDtime and the actual
arrival time of the TPA Response frame.
At aRelayTPATime (10.38) from the end of the last TPA Request frame transmitted by the destination
REDS to the source REDS, the destination REDS shall send a TPA Request frame to the RDS and set the
Timing Offset field to dTDS–dTDR. Upon reception of the TPA Request frame, the RDS shall transmit a TPA
Response frame to the destination REDS at aDtime+dTDR+(dTDS–dTDR) from the end of the TPA Request
frame. Upon reception of the TPA Response frame, the destination REDS shall estimate the time deviation
(i.e., 2×dTDR+(dTDS–dTDR)) between aDtime and the actual arrival time of the TPA Response frame. If the
destination REDS determines that the estimated deviation is equal to 2×dTDR+(dTDS–dTDR), then the
destination REDS considers that the TPA procedure was successful. As the last step of the TPA procedure,
the destination REDS shall send a TPA Report frame to the source REDS that includes the information
regardless of whether the last TPA procedure succeeded.
If it is not successful, the TPA procedure is repeated until it is successful or upon the decision of the
destination REDS to stop performing the TPA procedure. The TPA procedure can include the estimation of
the sampling frequency-offset (SFO), in order for the source REDS and RDS to adjust their SFOs.
9.39.3.2 Frame exchange operation
9.39.3.2.1 General
A source REDS that has successfully completed an RLS procedure with a destination REDS for which the
value of the Cooperation-Mode subfield within the negotiated Relay Transfer Parameter Set element is equal
to 1 and has successfully completed the TPA procedure shall use the selected RDS between the source
REDS and destination REDS for the purpose of link cooperation. This is described in this subclause.
9.39.3.2.2 Cooperative transmission SP request and allocation
If the source REDS receives a TPA Report frame that indicates the successful completion of the TPA
procedure with the RDS and the destination REDS, the source REDS uses the procedure in 10.4 to request

 As shown in the example of Figure 9-80, in the allocated SP the first time interval (T1) and the second time

 The data transmission rules are as follows. At the start of each time T1, the source REDS transmits a frame
 with its transmit antenna pattern directed towards the RDS and with the TA and the RA fields in the MAC
 header set to the MAC address of the source REDS and destination REDS, respectively. After Ptime+dTSR
 from the start of T2, the source REDS retransmits the same frame sent to the RDS during the previous time
 T1 but now with its transmit antenna pattern directed towards the destination REDS. Similarly, after
 Ptime+(dTDS–dTDR) from the start of T2, the RDS retransmits the same frame it received from the source
 REDS during the previous time T1. So that the destination REDS can take advantage of the improved
 received signal level from both of these transmissions, the destination REDS should set its receive antenna
 pattern during T2 such that it simultaneously covers the links towards both the source REDS and the RDS.
 The Ack policy used during an SP where link cooperation is in use is the same as defined in Clause 9.
 9.39.4 Relay link adaptation
 When a relay link is used for communication between a source REDS and a destination REDS, the link
 qualities of the S-R link, the R-D link, and the S-D link might be required.
 The source REDS, destination REDS, and RDS use the procedure described in 9.37 to request and report the
 link quality among themselves with the following exception. In the Link Measurement Report frame the
 RDS transmits to the source REDS, the RDS shall include two Link Margin elements in this order:
    —     The first Link Margin element shall report the link quality between the source REDS and the RDS.
    —     The second Link Margin element shall report the link quality between the RDS and the destination
          REDS.
 Upon reception of a Link Measurement Report frame, the source REDS can take several actions including
 changing the MCS it uses for frame transmission to the RDS and destination REDS.

10.1 Synchronization
10.1.1 General
Insert the following paragraph at the end of 10.1.1:
A multi-band capable device (10.32) shall maintain a local TSF timer for each channel that the STA operates
in.
10.1.2 Basic approach
10.1.2.1 TSF for infrastructure networks and PBSS networks
Change 10.1.2.1 as follows:
In an infrastructure BSS or in a PBSS, the AP in the infrastructure BSS or the PCP in the PBSS shall be the
timing master for the TSF. A STA that is the AP or the PCP shall initialize its TSF timer independently of
any simultaneously started APs or PCPs, respectively, in an effort to minimize the synchronization of the
TSF timers of multiple APs or PCPs. In a non-DMG BSS, Tthe AP shall periodically transmit special frames
called Beacon frames. In a DMG BSS, the PCP/AP shall periodically transmit special frames called DMG
Beacon and Announce frames, which provide a similar function to the Beacon frame in a non-DMG BSS.
Beacon, DMG Beacon, and Announce frames that contain the value of its the PCP’s or AP’s TSF timer to
synchronize the TSF timers of other STAs in a BSS. A receiving STA shall accept the timing information in
Beacon, DMG Beacon, and Announce frames sent from the AP and PCP servicing its BSS. If a STA’s TSF
timer is different from the timestamp in the received Beacon, DMG Beacon, or Announce frame, the
receiving STA shall set its local TSF timer to the received timestamp value.
In a non-DMG BSS, Beacon frames shall be generated for transmission by the AP once every
dot11BeaconPeriod TUs. In a DMG infrastructure BSS, zero or more DMG Beacon frames shall be
generated for transmission by the AP every dot11BeaconPeriod TUs (see 10.1.3.2a). The AP shall transmit
at least one DMG Beacon frame through each sector available to the AP within a time interval that is not
longer than dot11BeaconPeriod × dot11MaxLostBeacons TUs. The TXSS Span field in the DMG Beacon
shall be set to a value that is less than or equal to the dot11MaxLostBeacons attribute.
In a PBSS, the value of the TSF timer is delivered to the DMG STA by the DMG Beacon frames generated
at each BTI and by the Announce frames generated during the ATI. In a PBSS, at TBTTs that do not start
with a BTI, the PCP begins a beacon interval with an ATI sequence (see 10.1.3.2a.2). The time interval in
between two consecutive BTIs shall be an integer multiple of dot11BeaconPeriod TUs. The PCP shall
transmit at least one DMG Beacon frame to each associated STA within a time interval that is not longer
than dot11BeaconPeriod × dot11MaxLostBeacons TUs. The PCP shall transmit at least one DMG Beacon
frame through each possible antenna configuration in a full-coverage set of antenna configurations within
the number of beacon intervals specified within the most recently updated TXSS Span field.

 or one Announce frame every dot11BeaconPeriod × dot11MaxLostBeacons TUs.
 A STA sending a Beacon frame shall set the value of the Beacon frame’s timestamp so that it equals the
 value of the STA’s TSF timer at the time that the data symbol containing the first bit of the timestamp is
 transmitted to the PHY plus the transmitting STA’s delays through its local PHY from the MAC-PHY
 interface to its interface with the WM [e.g., antenna, light-emitting diode (LED) emission surface]. A STA
 sending a DMG Beacon or an Announce frame shall set the value of the frame’s timestamp field to equal the
 value of the STA’s TSF timer at the time that the transmission of the data symbol containing the first bit of
 the MPDU is started on the air (which can be derived from the PHY-TXPLCPEND.indication primitive),
 including any transmitting STA’s delays through its local PHY from the MAC-PHY interface to its interface
 with the WM.

 10.1.3.2 Beacon generation in non-DMG infrastructure networks
 Insert the following subclauses, 10.1.3.2a to 10.1.3.2b (including Figure 10-1a), after 10.1.3.2:
 10.1.3.2a Beacon generation in a DMG infrastructure BSS and in a PBSS
 10.1.3.2a.1 General
 A DMG STA acting as a PCP/AP follows the DMG channel access procedures (see 9.33) and the rules
 described in this subclause to transmit DMG Beacon frames.
 Each DMG Beacon frame transmitted by a PCP and by a DMG AP shall have the Discovery Mode field
 within the DMG Beacon set to 0.
 The Duration field of each transmitted DMG Beacon frame shall be set to the time remaining until the end of
 the current BTI.
 A PCP and a DMG AP establish a series of Target Beacon Transmission Times (TBTTs) spaced
 dot11BeaconPeriod TUs apart. The period between two TBTTs is referred to as the beacon interval. The
 beacon interval length shall be no more than aMaxBIDuration. Time value zero of the TSF is defined to be a
 TBTT with a DMG Beacon frame transmitted at the beginning of the beacon interval.
 The length of the beacon interval is included in the DMG Beacon, Announce, and Probe Response frames,
 and the DMG STAs shall adopt that beacon interval when joining the BSS.
 A PCP and a DMG AP that move the TBTT (10.30.2) or change the beacon interval duration (10.30.3) shall
 reestablish the TBTT by resetting the TSF to zero at the time the BSS parameter change takes effect in the
 BSS.
 At each BTI, a PCP and a DMG AP schedule DMG Beacon frames for transmission according to the
 procedure specified in 9.35.4. Subject to this constraint, the PCP/AP may delay the DMG Beacon
 transmission if the medium is determined by the CCA mechanism to be busy. When delaying a DMG
 Beacon transmission, the PCP/AP shall check that the BTI, A-BFT, and ATI do not overlap in time with
 pseudo-static SPs for which the PCP/AP is not the source DMG STA and, if PCP/AP clustering is in use,
 that the DMG Beacon transmission follows the additional rules described in 9.34.

A PCP/AP may transmit DMG Beacon frames through different antenna configurations during the BTI, but
shall not transmit more than one DMG Beacon frame through the same antenna configuration during the
BTI of any beacon interval. For any beacon interval that does not include a DMG Beacon transmission in the
BTI, the AP shall begin the beacon interval with an ATI, and the PCP begins the beacon interval with an
ATI (10.2.5.3).
When the DMG Beacon transmission is performed as multiple directional transmissions, a PCP/AP should
change the sequence of directions through which a DMG Beacon is transmitted after it has transmitted a
DMG Beacon frame through each direction in the current sequence of directions. When the ECPAC Policy
Enforced field is equal to 1 in the DMG Beacon frame most recently transmitted by a PCP/AP, then
   —     When the PCP/AP transmits a DMG Beacon frame as multiple directional transmissions, the PCP/
         AP shall change the sequence of directions through which a DMG Beacon frame is transmitted after
         it has transmitted a DMG Beacon frame through each direction in the current sequence of directions.
   —     When the PCP/AP transmits a DMG Beacon frame as a single transmission, the PCP/AP shall
         randomly delay the transmission of the DMG Beacon frame by up to min(4×TXTIME(DMG
         Beacon), 1024×dot11MinBHIDuration) μs after the TBTT.
This is done to randomize and potentially minimize interference to/from the DMG Beacon. One such
example is indicated in Figure 10-1a. If the sequence of directions is changed, the sequence of directions
shall be pseudorandomly chosen from a sequence of directions covering the full set of directions available to
a PCP/AP.

Only field within the DMG Beacon frame is equal to 0 and the Extended Schedule element is included in the

 10.1.3.2b DMG Beacon generation before network initialization
 A DMG STA can transmit DMG Beacon frames before network initialization to discover and perform
 beamforming during the A-BFT with another DMG STA so that the following frame exchanges between
 these DMG STAs do not have to be done as a sector sweep (see 10.1.4.3.3).
 A DMG STA that transmits DMG Beacon frames before network initialization shall set the Discovery Mode
 field in each transmitted DMG Beacon frame to 1 to indicates that the network initialization procedure
 defined in 10.1.4.4 has not been performed. In addition, the STA shall set the Next A-BFT field to 0.
 Before network initialization, the spacing between TBTTs can change, and the time to the next TBTT is
 contained in each DMG Beacon transmitted at the last BTI. At each TBTT, the DMG STA should generate a
 random value for the Beacon Interval field within the DMG Beacon frame from a uniform distribution
 between [10 TUs, 200 TUs), i.e., 10 TUs inclusive through 200 TUs exclusive. All DMG Beacon frame
 transmissions within the same BTI shall have the same value for the Beacon Interval field.
 The TSF shall be set to 0 at the first TBTT for which the Discovery Mode field within the DMG Beacon
 frame is equal to 1. After that, the TSF shall be set to 0 at the TBTT of the beacon interval in which the
 DMG STA changes the value of the Beacon Interval field.
 The DMG STA shall transmit the first DMG Beacon frame of the next BTI at the time indicated by the start
 of the transmission of the first DMG Beacon frame within the last BTI and the value of the Beacon Interval
 field contained in the DMG Beacon frame transmitted within the last BTI, unless the medium is determined
 by the CCA mechanism to be busy in which case the DMG STA may delay the transmission of the first
 DMG Beacon transmission.
 A DMG STA that transmits a DMG Beacon frame with the Discovery Mode field equal to 1 may indicate
 the STA(s) that is allowed to respond in the A-BFT following the BTI where the DMG Beacon frame is
 transmitted. To do that, in the DMG Beacon the DMG STA shall set the CC Present field to 1 and shall set
 the A-BFT Responder Address subfield to an individual address or to a group address of a group that
 includes the STA(s) that is allowed to respond in the A-BFT.
 A DMG STA that is transmitting DMG Beacon frames with the Discovery Mode field equal to 1 should
 configure its receive antenna to a quasi-omni antenna pattern and stay in receiving state during portions of
 the DTI defined by the DMG Beacon transmissions. This enables the DMG STA to receive frames
 transmitted by any DMG STA that is covered by this antenna pattern.
 A DMG STA that is transmitting DMG Beacon frames with the Discovery Mode field equal to 1 should
 cease transmitting these beacons when it has received a DMG Beacon frame from another STA, or when it
 has received acknowledgment of a transmitted Probe Response frame. If a BSS is not initialized as a result
 of the channel scanning, the DMG STA can resume transmitting DMG Beacon frames with the Discovery
 Mode field equal to 1.
 The procedure of TBTT change described in the preceding paragraph is applicable for DMG Beacon
 generation before network initialization, whereas the procedures defined in 10.30.2 and 10.30.3 are used to
 change the DMG BSS parameters after the infrastructure BSS and PBSS are initialized.
 The DMG STA shall set the Duration field of each transmitted DMG Beacon frame to the time remaining
 until the end of the current BTI.

10.1.3.3 Beacon generation in an IBSS
Change the first paragraph in 10.1.3.3 as follows:
Beacon generation in an IBSS is distributed. The beacon period is included in Beacon, Announce, and Probe
Response frames, and STAs shall adopt that beacon period when joining the IBSS. All members of the IBSS
participate in beacon generation. Each STA shall maintain its own TSF timer that is used for
dot11BeaconPeriod timing. The beacon interval within an IBSS is established by the STA at which the
MLME-START.request primitive is performed to create the IBSS. This defines a series of TBTTs exactly
dot11BeaconPeriod TUs apart. Time zero is defined to be a TBTT. At each TBTT the STA shall
   a)    Suspend the decrementing of the backoff timer for any pending transmission that is not a non-
         Beacon or DMG Beacon frame transmission,
   b)    Calculate a random delay uniformly distributed in the range between zero and twice aCWmin×
         aSlotTime when the STA is a non-DMG STA, and between zero and the result of two multiplied by
         aCWminDMGIBSS multiplied by the duration of the STA’s following BTI when the STA is a DMG
         STA,
   c)    Wait for the period of the random delay, decrementing the random delay timer using the same
         algorithm as for backoff,
   d)    Cancel the remaining random delay and the pending Beacon frame transmission or BTI (DMG
         only), if a Beacon frame arrives from the IBSS of which the STA is a member before the random
         delay timer has expired,
   e)    Send a Beacon frame in a non-DMG BSS or DMG Beacon frame(s) in a DMG BSS if the random
         delay has expired and no Beacon frame in a non-DMG BSS or no DMG Beacon frame in a DMG
         BSS has arrived from the IBSS of which the STA is a member during the delay period,
   f)    If the ATIM Window in use within the IBSS is greater than 0, then
         1)    Resume decrementing the backoff timer for any pending transmission allowed inside the ATIM
               window and
         2)    At the time of the ATIM Window duration, resume the backoff for any pending frames
               intended for transmission outside the ATIM Window,
   g)    If the ATIM Window in use within the IBSS is 0, then resume decrementing the backoff timer for
         any pending transmissions.
10.1.3.5 Beacon reception
Change the second and third paragraphs of 10.1.3.5 as follows:
STAs in an infrastructure network or PBSS shall use information that is not in the CF Parameter Set element
in received Beacon frames or DMG Beacon frames or Announce frames only if the BSSID field is equal to
the MAC address currently in use by the STA contained in the AP of the BSS or to the MAC address
currently in use by the PCP of the PBSS. Non-AP or non-PCP STAs in an infrastructure or PBSS network,
respectively, that support the Multiple BSSID capability shall use other information in received Beacon or
DMG Beacon frames only if the BSSID field of a non-AP or non-PCP STA is equal to the MAC address
currently in use by the STA contained in the AP or PCP, respectively, of the BSS corresponding to the
transmitted BSSID or if the BSSID field of a non-AP or non-PCP STA is equal to one of the nontransmitted
BSSIDs.
STAs in an non-DMG IBSS shall use information that is not in the CF Parameter Set element in any
received Beacon frame for which the IBSS subfield of the Capability field is 1, the content of the SSID
element is equal to the SSID of the IBSS, and the TSF value is later than the receiving STA’s TSF timer. Use
of this information is specified in 10.1.5.
Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.                                                              333
IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                               LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 Insert the following paragraphs at the end of 10.1.3.5:
 DMG STAs in an IBSS shall use other information in any received DMG Beacon and Announce frames for
 which the BSS Type subfield is 1, the content of the SSID element is equal to the SSID of the IBSS, and the
 TSF value is later than the receiving STA’s TSF timer. Use of this information is specified in 10.1.5.
 A STA shall ignore the BSS Type field contained in a received DMG Beacon frame if the Discovery Mode
 field within the DMG Beacon is 1.
 An active STA operating in a BSS shall be ready to receive a DMG Beacon or a frame from the PCP/AP for
 a period of time of at least dot11MinBHIDuration following the TBTT or expected ATI start time as
 specified in the last Next DMG ATI element (8.4.2.137) transmitted by the PCP/AP.
 An active DMG STA that is receive beamforming trained with the PCP/AP shall direct its receive antenna
 pattern toward the PCP/AP or use a quasi-omni antenna pattern during this time.
 A non-PCP STA that receives a DMG Beacon frame from a PCP in which the PCP Association Ready field
 is 0 shall not transmit an Association Request frame addressed to the PCP that transmitted the received
 DMG Beacon. A non-PCP STA that receives a DMG Beacon frame from a PCP with the PCP Association
 Ready field set to 1 may transmit an Association Request frame addressed to the PCP that transmitted the
 received DMG Beacon.
 10.1.3.6 Multiple BSSID procedure
 Change 10.1.3.6 as follows:
 Implementation of the Multiple BSSID capability is optional for a WNM STA and for a DMG STA. A STA
 that implements the Multiple BSSID capability has dot11MgmtOptionMultiBSSIDImplemented set to true.
 When dot11MgmtOptionMultiBSSIDImplemented is true, dot11WirelessManagementImplemented shall be
 set true except for a DMG STA, in which case it may be set to false. A STA that has a value of true for
 dot11MgmtOptionMultiBSSIDActivated is defined as a STA that supports the Multiple BSSID capability.
 A STA for which dot11MgmtOptionMultiBSSIDActivated is true shall set the Multiple BSSID field of the
 Extended Capabilities element to 1.
 The nontransmitted BSSID profile shall include the SSID element (see 8.4.2.2) and Multiple BSSID-Index
 element (see 8.4.2.76) for each of the supported BSSIDs. The PCP/AP may optionally include all other
 elements in the nontransmitted BSSID profile. The PCP/AP may include two or more Multiple BSSID
 elements containing elements for a given BSSID index in one Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame. If two
 or more are given, the profile is considered to be the complete set of all elements given in all such Multiple
 BSSID elements sharing the same BSSID index. Since the Multiple BSSID element is also present in Probe
 Response frames, an PCP/AP may choose to advertise the complete or a partial profile of a BSS
 corresponding to a nontransmitted BSSID only in the Probe Response frames. In addition, the PCP/AP may
 choose to include only a partial list of nontransmitted BSSID profiles in the Beacon frame or DMG Beacon
 frame or to include different sets of nontransmitted BSSID profiles in different Beacon frames or DMG
 Beacon frames.
 When a station receives a Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame with a Multiple BSSID element that consists
 of a nontransmitted BSSID profile with only the mandatory elements, it may inherit the complete profile
 from a previously received Beacon frame, DMG Beacon frame, or Probe Response frame, or it may send a
 Probe Request frame to obtain the complete BSSID profiles. Each Beacon element not transmitted in a
 nontransmitted BSSID subelement is inherited from a previous Beacon, DMG Beacon, or Probe Response
 frame in which the element is present, except for the Quiet element, which shall take effect only in the
 Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame that contains it and not carry forward as a part of the inheritance. An
 PCP/AP is not required to include all supported nontransmitted BSSID profiles in a Probe Response frame
 334                                                                    Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

and may choose to include only a subset based on any criteria. When a nontransmitted BSSID profile is
present in the Multiple BSSID element of the Probe Response frame, the PCP/AP shall include all elements
that are specific to this BSS. If any of the optional elements is not present in a nontransmitted BSSID profile,
the corresponding values are the element values of the transmitted BSSID.
A non-PCP/non-AP STA derives its nontransmitted BSSID value according to 8.4.2.48 and 8.4.2.76.
The Partial Virtual Bitmap field in the transmitted BSSID Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame shall
indicate the presence or absence of traffic to be delivered to all stations associated to a transmitted or
nontransmitted BSSID. The first 2n bits of the bitmap are reserved for the indication of group addressed
frames for the transmitted and all nontransmitted BSSIDs. The AID space is shared by all BSSs, and the
lowest AID value that shall be assigned to a station is 2n (see 8.4.2.7).
Operation in a non-DMG BSS is subject to the following additional rules. If the contention-free period is
supported and if the CFPCount of more than one BSS becomes 0 in the same Beacon frame, the AP shall
concatenate the contention-free periods of all CFPs that coincide and shall not transmit a CF-End or CF-
End+Ack until the end of the concatenated CFP, indicated with a single CF-End or CF-End+Ack, if
required. The CF Parameter Set in the transmitted BSSID contains times that are an aggregate of CFP times
of the nontransmitted BSSIDs.
Multiple BSSID rate selection is defined in 9.7.7.
10.1.3.7 TSF timer accuracy
Change of 10.1.3.7 as follows:
Upon receiving a Beacon or a DMG Beacon or an Announce frame with a valid FCS and BSSID or SSID, as
described in 10.1.3.5, a STA shall update its TSF timer according to the following algorithm:
   —     Non-DMG STA: The received timestamp value shall be adjusted by adding an amount equal to the
         receiving STA’s delay through its local PHY components plus the time since the first bit of the
         timestamp was received at the MAC/PHY interface.
   —     DMG STA: The received timestamp value shall be adjusted by adding an amount equal to the
         receiving STA’s delay through its local PHY components plus the time since the last data symbol of
         the PLCP header, excluding any guard interval, was received as indicated by PHY_RXSTART.ind.
In the case of an infrastructure BSS or a PBSS, the STA’s TSF timer shall then be set to the adjusted value of
the timestamp. In the case of an IBSS, the STA’s TSF timer shall be set to the adjusted value of the received
timestamp, if the adjusted value of the timestamp is later than the value of the STA’s TSF timer. The
accuracy of the TSF timer shall be no worse than ± 0.01%.
When an STA is associated to a BSS with a nontransmitted BSSID, it shall use the TSF from the transmitted
BSSID beacon frame.
10.1.4 Acquiring synchronization, scanning
10.1.4.1 General
Change the third paragraph of 10.1.4.1 as follows:
Upon receipt of the MLME-SCAN.request primitive, a STA shall perform scanning. The SSID parameter
indicates the SSID for which to scan. The SSID List parameter indicates one or more SSIDs for which to
scan. To become a member of a particular ESS using passive scanning, a STA shall scan for Beacon and
DMG Beacon frames containing that ESS’s SSID, returning all Beacon and DMG Beacon frames matching

 the desired SSID in the BSSDescriptionSet parameter of the corresponding MLME-SCAN.confirm
 primitive with the appropriate bits in the Capabilities Information field or DMG Capabilities field indicating
 whether the Beacon frame or the DMG Beacon frame came from an infrastructure BSS, PBSS, or IBSS. If
 the value of dot11RMMeasurementPilotActivated is greater than 1, the STA shall additionally scan for
 Measurement Pilot frames, returning in the BSSDescriptionFromMeasurementPilotSet parameter all
 Measurement Pilot frames that equal the requested BSSID of the corresponding MLME-SCAN.request
 primitive and are not already members of the BSSDescriptionSet. To actively scan, the STA shall transmit
 Probe request frames containing the desired SSID or one or more SSID List elements, but a DMG STA
 might also have to transmit DMG Beacon frames or perform beamforming training prior to the transmission
 of Probe Request frames. When the SSID List element is present in the Probe Request frame, one or more of
 the SSID elements may include a wildcard SSID (see 8.4.2.2). The exact procedure for determining the
 SSID or SSID List values in the MLME-SCAN.request primitive is not specified in this standard. When a
 STA scans for a BSS whose AP does not support the SSID List element, or for a BSS for which AP support
 of the SSID List element is unknown, the SSID element with an SSID or wildcard SSID shall be included in
 the MLME-SCAN.request primitive. Upon completion of scanning, an MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive is
 issued by the MLME indicating all of the BSS information received.
 Insert the following paragraph after the third paragraph of 10.1.4.1 as follows:
 In DMG BSSs, the Active Scan procedure (10.1.4.3) can be used for device discovery prior to initializing or
 joining a BSS.
 Change the now sixth paragraph of 10.1.4.1 as follows:
 Upon receipt of an MLME-SCAN.request primitive with the SSID parameter set to the wildcard SSID, the
 STA shall passively scan for any Beacon or DMG Beacon or Meassurement Pilot frames, or actively
 transmit Probe Request or DMG Beacon frames containing the wildcard SSID, as appropriate depending
 upon the value of ScanMode. Upon completion of scanning, an MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive is issued
 by the MLME indicating all of the BSS information received.
 Change the now ninth paragraph of 10.1.4.1 as follows:
 When a STA starts a BSS, that STA shall determine the BSSID of the BSS. If the BSSType indicates an
 infrastructure BSS, then the STA shall start an infrastructure BSS, and the BSSID shall be equal to the
 STA’s dot11StationID. If the BSSType indicates a PBSS, then the STA shall start a PBSS. For both the
 infrastructure BSS and the PBSS, Tthe value of the BSSID shall remain unchanged, even if the value of
 dot11StationID is changed after the completion of the MLME-START.request primitive. If the BSSType
 indicates an IBSS, the STA shall start an IBSS, and the BSSID shall be an individual locally administered
 IEEE MAC address as defined in 9.2 of IEEE Std 802-2001. The remaining 46 bits of that MAC address
 shall be a number selected in a manner that minimizes the probability of STAs generating the same number,
 even when those STAs are subjected to the same initial conditions. The value SSID parameter shall be used
 as the SSID of the new BSS. It is important that designers recognize the need for statistical independence
 among the random number streams among STAs.
 10.1.4.2 Passive scanning
 Change 10.1.4.2 as follows:
 10.1.4.2.1 Passive scanning for non-DMG STAs
 If the ScanType parameter indicates a passive scan, the STA shall listen to each channel scanned for no
 longer than a maximum duration defined by the MaxChannelTime parameter.

Insert the following subclause, 10.1.4.2.2, after 10.1.4.2.1:
10.1.4.2.2 Passive scanning for DMG STAs
Upon receipt of the MLME-SCAN.request primitive with the ScanType parameter set to Passive, a DMG
STA shall passively scan for transmissions on each channel specified within the ChannelList parameter of
the MLME-SCAN.request primitive. The channel traversal order during passive scanning is implementation
specific.
That is, the DMG STA shall be in the receive state scanning for a period of time in a channel no less than
MinChannelTime and return information on all DMG Beacon frames received matching a particular BSSID
or SSID parameters specified in the MLME-SCAN.request primitive. If no DMG Beacon scan parameters
are specified in the request, then the DMG STA shall return information on all received DMG Beacon
frames.
If at any time during the scan the DMG STA detects a non-DMG Beacon frame, the DMG STA shall
continue to scan the current channel until the scanning timer expires. After scanning one channel, the DMG
STA shall initiate scanning in another channel if at least one channel within the ChannelList parameter has
not yet been scanned.
When the DMG STA has completed scanning all indicated channels, it returns the scan results via the
MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive.
10.1.4.3 Active scanning
10.1.4.3.2 Sending a probe response
Change the third and fourth paragraphs of 10.1.4.3.2 as follows:
Only DMG STAs that are not members of a PBSS but that have transmitted at least one DMG Beacon frame
with the Discovery Mode field set to 1, multi-band capable non-AP STAs for which the last received probe
request included a Multi-band element, APs, PCPs, and STAs in an IBSS or in an MBSS respond to probe
requests. A result of the procedures defined in this subclause is that in each infrastructure BSS, except in
DMG BSSs, and IBSS, there is at least one STA that is awake at any given time to receive and respond to
probe requests. In an MBSS, STAs might not be awake at any given time to respond to probe requests. In an
infrastructure BSS or in an IBSS, a STA that sent a Beacon frame shall remain in the Awake state and shall
respond to probe requests, subject to criteria in the next paragraph, until a Beacon frame with the current
BSSID is received. If the STA is contained within an AP, it shall remain in the Awake state and always
respond to probe requests, subject to criteria in the next paragraph. There may be more than one STA in an
IBSS that responds to any given probe request, particularly in cases where more than one STA transmitted a
Beacon/DMG Beacon frame following the most recent TBTT, either due to not receiving successfully a
previous Beacon/DMG Beacon frame or due to collisions between beacon transmissions.
In an infrastructure BSS or in an IBSS, STAs receiving Probe Request frames shall respond with a probe
response when the SSID in the probe request is the wildcard SSID or matches the specific SSID of the STA
or when the specific SSID of the STA is included in the SSID List element. Furthermore, a STA with
dot11RadioMeasurementActivated true receiving a probe request with a DSSS Parameter Set element
containing a Current Channel field value that is not the same as the value of dot11CurrentChannel shall not
respond with a probe response. A DMG STA that is not member of a PBSS but that has transmitted at least
one DMG Beacon with the Discovery Mode field set to 1, Aan AP, and a PCP shall respond to all probe
requests meeting the above criteria. In an IBSS, a STA that transmitted a Beacon or DMG Beacon frame
since the last TBTT shall respond to group addressed Probe Request frames. A STA in an IBSS shall
respond to Probe Request frames sent to the individual address of the STA.

 10.1.4.3.3 Active scanning procedure
 Change the second and third paragraphs in 10.1.4.3.3 as follows:
 For each channel to be scanned:
   a)    Wait until the ProbeDelay time has expired or a PHYRxStart.indication primitive has been received.
   b)    Perform the Basic Access procedure as defined in 9.3.4.2 if the STA is a non-DMG STA.
   c)    If the STA is a DMG STA:
         1)    Start generation of DMG Beacon frames according to the rules described in 10.1.3.2b if the
               STA intends to transmit DMG Beacon frames with the Discovery Mode field set to 1.
         2)    Otherwise, proceed to step (e).
   d)    If a DMG Beacon frame is received, perform the beamforming training defined in 9.35.5.
   e)    If the STA is a DMG STA, perform the basic access procedure defined in 9.3.4.2.
   f)    c) Send a probe request to the broadcast destination address or, in the case of a DMG STA only, (i)
         following the transmission of an SSW-Feedback frame, send a probe request to the MAC address of
         the DMG STA addressed by the SSW-Feedback frame or (ii) optionally, following the reception of
         an SSW-Feedback frame, send a probe request to the MAC address of the DMG STA that
         transmitted the SSW-Feedback frame. In all these cases, the probe request is sent with the SSID and
         BSSID from the MLME-SCAN.request primitive. When transmitted by a DMG STA, the probe
         request includes the DMG Capabilities element. When the SSID List is present in the MLME-
         SCAN.request primitive, send one or more probe request frames, each with an SSID indicated in the
         SSID List and the BSSID from the MLME-SCAN.request primitive.
   g)    d) Set to 0 and start a ProbeTimer.
   h)    e) If PHY-CCA.indication (busy) has not been detected before the ProbeTimer reaches
         MinChannelTime, then
         1)    If the STA is a non-DMG STA, set the NAV to 0 and scan the next channel,.
         2)    Otherwise, else when ProbeTimer reaches MaxChannelTime, process all received probe
               responses.
   i)    f) Set the NAV to 0 and scan the next channel.

10.1.4.3.4 PCP selection in a PBSS
The PCP selection procedure is performed by the SME in the following cases:
  —      At the reception of an MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive that was received in response to an MLME-
         SCAN.request primitive with the value of the ScanType parameter equal to ACTIVE and BSSType
         parameter equal to PERSONAL
  —      As part of a PCP handover (see 10.28.2).
The decision whether the STA performs in the role of PCP is done by comparing the value of the STA’s PCP
Factor (self_PCP_factor) and the PCP Factor of the peer STA (peer_PCP_factor) that is indicated in the peer
STA’s DMG Capabilities element.
The PCP Factor of a STA is constructed by concatenating the value of select fields present in the STA’s
DMG Capabilities element defined in 8.4.2.130. The PCP Factor is defined in Figure 10-3b.

For each peer STA reported as part of an MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive or considered as part of a PCP
handover, the STA proceeds as follows. If the STA’s value of self_PCP_factor is greater than the value of
peer_PCP_factor or if the values are equal and the MAC address of the STA is greater than the MAC
address of the peer STA contained in the peer STA’s DMG Capabilities element, the STA becomes a
candidate PCP. Otherwise, the STA does not become a candidate PCP. For the purpose of this MAC address
comparison, the first transmitted octet shall be interpreted as the most significant octet (i.e., big endian).

 The rules the SME of a candidate PCP follows to initialize a PBSS are described in 10.1.4.4.2.
 10.1.4.4 Initializing a BSS
 Change 10.1.4.4 as follows:
 10.1.4.4.1 General
 Upon receipt of an MLME-START.request primitive, a STA shall determine the BSS’s BSSID (as described
 in 10.1.4), select channel synchronization information, select a beacon period, select the operational rate set,
 initialize and start its TSF timer, and begin transmitting Beacon frames if the STA is a non-DMG STA or
 DMG Beacon frames if the STA is a DMG STA.
 A STA shall include a Country element in the transmission of Beacon frames and DMG Beacon frames if
 dot11MultiDomainCapabilityActivated,                    dot11SpectrumManagementRequired,                        or
 dot11RadioMeasurementActivated is true. See 8.3.3.2 for the description of a properly formed Beacon
 frame, and see 8.3.4.1 for the description of a properly formed DMG Beacon frame.
 Insert the following subclause, 10.1.4.4.2, after 10.1.4.4.1:
 10.1.4.4.2 Initializing a DMG BSS
 Prior to choosing a suitable operating channel and starting a BSS, the SME of a DMG STA should perform
 a channel scan to ascertain the quality of each channel that the STA supports. The rules for choosing a
 suitable operating channel are implementation specific and might be subject to regulatory requirements.
 Upon receipt of an MLME-START.request primitive from the SME, the MAC entity of the DMG STA shall
 try to start a BSS. The DMG STA may listen for a duration of aMinChannelTime, the listening duration, in
 the channel specified by the SME in the request. If the DMG STA determines the channel is suitable for BSS
 operation at the end of this listening duration, the DMG STA initializes the BSS by commencing
 transmission of DMG Beacon frames according to 10.1.3.2a in the case of a PBSS or an infrastructure BSS
 and according to 10.1.3.3 in the case of an IBSS. If PCP/AP clustering is in use on the selected channel, the
 DMG Beacon transmission by a PCP/AP commences following the additional rules described in 9.34.
 If the DMG STA determines that no channels are suitable or available, it responds with an MLME-
 START.confirm primitive with a ResultCode of NOT_SUPPORTED. Otherwise, the MLME shall respond
 with an MLME-START.confirm primitive with a ResultCode of SUCCESS.
 The SME should issue an MLME-START.request primitive with BSSType parameter equal to PERSONAL
 for at least one network in which the STA becomes a candidate PCP as defined in 10.1.4.3.4. If the STA
 becomes a candidate PCP of more than one network, the SME may issue an MLME-START.request
 primitive with BSSType parameter equal to PERSONAL for any of the remaining networks. In either case,
 the MLME-START.request primitive should be issued no later than 4×aMaxBIDuration since the reception
 of an MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive.
 The SME should not issue an MLME-START.request primitive with BSSType parameter equal to
 PERSONAL for networks in which the STA does not become a candidate PCP as defined in 10.1.4.3.4. If
 the SME issues the MLME-START.request primitive under this circumstance, it shall not be issued if less
 than 4×aMaxBIDuration has elapsed since the reception of the MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive.

10.1.4.5 Synchronizing with a BSS
Insert the following paragraph at the end of 10.1.4.5:
A DMG STA shall be capable of transmitting DMG Beacon frames. A DMG STA shall adopt the
operational parameters transmitted by its PCP/AP within the DMG Operation Information field of the DMG
Operation element. A DMG STA shall update the value of its local MIB variables with the corresponding
field value transmitted by its PCP/AP within the DMG BSS Parameter Configuration field of the DMG
Operation element (8.4.2.131). Except for the predicate “dot11” used in the MIB variable naming
convention, the name of the field is the same as the name of the corresponding MIB variable.
10.1.5 Adjusting STA timers
Change 10.1.5 as follows:
In an infrastructure BSS or PBSS, STAs shall adopt the TSF timer value in a Beacon, frame or Pprobe
Rresponse, DMG Beacon, or Announce frame coming from the PCP/AP in their BSS by using the algorithm
in 10.1.3.7.
In response to an MLME-JOIN.request primitive, a STA joining an IBSS shall initialize its TSF timer to 0
and shall not transmit a Beacon, frame or Pprobe Rresponse, or DMG Beacon frame until it hears a Beacon,
frame or Pprobe Rresponse, or DMG Beacon frame from a member of the IBSS with a matching SSID.
Consequently, the STA joining an IBSS adopts the timer from the next Beacon, frame or Pprobe Rresponse,
or DMG Beacon frame from its IBSS.
All Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, and Probe Response frames carry a Timestamp field. A STA
receiving such a frame from another STA in an IBSS with the same SSID shall compare the Timestamp field
with its own TSF time. If the Timestamp field of the received frame is later than its own TSF timer, the non-
DMG STA in the IBSS shall adopt each parameter contained in the Beacon frame according to the rule for
that parameter found in the “IBSS adoption” column of the matching row of the BSSDescription table found
in 6.3.3.3.2. A DMG STA in an IBSS shall adopt each parameter contained in the DMG Beacon or
Announce frames. Parameters adopted by a STA due to the receipt of a later timestamp shall not be changed
by the STA except when adopting parameters due to a subsequently received Beacon, DMG Beacon, or
Announce frame with a later timestamp.
10.1.7 Terminating a network
Change 10.1.7 as follows:
An infrastructure BSS or a PBSS may be terminated at any time. A STA may cease support for an IBSS that
it formed at any time. Upon receipt of an MLME-STOP.request primitive, a STA shall stop transmitting
Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, and Probe Response frames and deauthenticate all associated STAs.

 10.2 Power management
 Change the title of 10.2.1 as follows:
 10.2.1 Power management in an non-DMG infrastructure network
 10.2.1.2 STA Power Management modes
 Insert the following paragraph at the end of 10.2.1.2:
 To change Power Management mode, a STA that is coordinated by an MM-SME shall inform the AP
 through a successful frame exchange initiated by the STA. The Power Management bit in the Frame Control
 field of the frame sent by the STA in this exchange indicates the Power Management mode that the STAs
 coordinated by the MM-SME and advertised in the MMS element sent by the STA shall adopt upon
 successful completion of the entire frame exchange. To change the Power Management mode of the
 coordinated STA, the frame may be sent using any of the MMSLs within the MMSL cluster established with
 the AP.
 10.2.4 SM power save
 Insert the following subclauses, 10.2.5 to 10.2.5.3 (including Figure 10-1a to Figure 10-1c, Table 10-1a,
 and Table 10-1b), after 10.2.4:
 10.2.5 Power management in a PBSS and DMG infrastructure BSS
 10.2.5.1 General
 To enable non-PCP/non-AP STAs and PCPs to sleep for one or more beacon intervals or part of a beacon
 interval, a non-PCP/non-AP STA power save mechanism and a PCP power save mechanism are defined in
 this subclause.
 Non-PCP/non-AP STA power save mode, as described in 10.2.5.2, allows a non-PCP/non-AP STA to sleep
 at intervals negotiated with the PCP/AP. Each non-PCP/non-AP STA can choose an independent wakeup
 schedule that fits its own power consumption and traffic delivery requirements.
 PCP Power Save (PPS) mode, as described in 10.2.5.3, allows a PCP to sleep at intervals to minimize the
 energy consumption. The PCP operating in PPS mode can choose an independent wakeup schedule to sleep
 for one or more consecutive beacon intervals and does not transmit DMG Beacons during this time.
 The Wakeup Schedule element is used to schedule the wakeup and sleeping of STAs. The Wakeup Schedule
 element defines two types of beacon intervals:
    —     Doze BI: a beacon interval that is explicitly defined as a Doze BI in the last, if any, Wakeup
          Schedule element successfully negotiated with the PCP/AP in the case of non-PCP/non-AP power
          save mode or transmitted by the PCP in the case of PCP power save mode.
    —     Awake BI: a beacon interval that is not defined as a Doze BI.
 A STA may operate in one of two power states:
    —     Awake: STA is fully powered.
    —     Doze: STA is not able to transmit or receive and consumes very low power.
 342                                                                    Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.
                                                                                                      IEEE
ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                 Std 802.11ad-2012
The manner in which a STA transitions between these two power states shall be determined by the STA’s
Power Management mode:
   —    Active mode: A STA is in the Awake state, except that the STA can switch to Doze state in an
        Awake BI when the STA is allowed to doze as indicated in Table 10-1a.
   —    Power Save (PS) mode: A STA alternates between the Awake and the Doze states, as determined by
        the rules defined in this subclause.
A PCP/AP keeps track of the wakeup schedules of all associated non-PCP/non-AP STAs. Each STA
delivers traffic to a peer STA only when the peer STA is in Awake state.
An AP shall buffer MPDUs addressed to non-AP STAs in Doze state. The buffered data shall be transmitted
only at designated times (10.2.5.2). A non-AP STA shall defer delivering of MPDUs addressed to other non-
AP STA in Doze state. The MPDUs shall be transmitted only at designated times (10.2.5.2).
If a PCP sets the BSS Type field within a transmitted DMG Beacon frame to PBSS or the PCP/AP includes
a Nontransmitted BSSID Capability element in a transmitted DMG Beacon, Announce, or Probe Response
frames and the BSS Type field within the Nontransmitted BSSID Capability element is equal to PBSS, then
the PCP/AP shall follow the PCP power management rules described in 10.2.5.3 if the PCP/AP chooses to
employ power management.
A PCP/AP may include an Antenna Sector ID Pattern element in Power Save Configuration Response and
Probe Response frames transmitted to a non-PCP/non-AP STA. If a non-PCP/non-AP STA uses the
information contained in the Antenna Sector ID Pattern element received from its PCP/AP, then during the
BTI of an Awake BI, the STA might stay awake just to receive DMG Beacon frames transmitted through
specific DMG antenna and sector and switch to Doze state during other periods in the BTI.
Table 10-1a lists the power states for a non-PCP/non-AP STA in PS mode and a PCP in PS mode during an
Awake BI. Each entry indicates the state, either Awake or Doze, for the non-PCP/non-AP STA or the PCP
in PS mode at various times during the Awake BI.

 from the destination DMG STA of the SP or the CBAP, respectively.

 10.2.5.2 Non-PCP/non-AP STA power management mode
 10.2.5.2.1 General
 The power management mode of a non-PCP/non-AP STA is selected by the PowerManagementMode
 parameter of the MLME-POWERMGT.request primitive. Once the STA updates its Power Management
 mode, the MLME shall issue an MLME-POWERMGT.confirm primitive indicating the result of the
 operation. A STA that acknowledges the reception of a PSC-RSP frame with Status Code indicating success
 shall update the STA’s power management mode at the instant indicated by the value of the BI Start Time

10.2.5.2.2 Power management mode operation of a non-PCP/non-AP STA with no wakeup
schedule
A non-PCP/non-AP STA that has not set up a wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP is in Active mode and
every beacon interval is an Awake BI. The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall enter PS mode only after a
successful frame exchange as described in Annex G, initiated by the non-PCP/non-AP STA and that
includes an acknowledgment from the PCP/AP. The Power Management field set to 1 in the Frame Control
field of the frame sent by the STA is used to indicate such a transition.
When a non-PCP/non-AP STA that has not set up a wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP enters PS mode,
every beacon interval shall be an Awake BI for that STA. A non-PCP/non-AP STA that has not set up a
wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP and that is in PS mode shall be awake during any allocated SP for which
the STA is either the source DMG STA or destination DMG STA during an Awake BI. During an Awake
BI, a non-PCP/non-AP STA that has not set up a wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP and that is in PS mode
shall be awake during any allocated CBAP for which the STA is the source DMG STA or destination DMG
STA, or the source AID of the CBAP is equal to the broadcast AID or the destination AID of the CBAP is
equal to the broadcast AID.

 10.2.5.2.3 Power management mode operation of a non-PCP/non-AP STA with a wakeup
 schedule
 To transition from Active mode to PS mode, a non-PCP/non-AP STA that is associated with a PCP/AP shall
 establish a wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP. A wakeup schedule (WS) is established with the PCP/AP
 following the successful transmission of a PSC-REQ frame to the PCP/AP with the DPM field set to 1 and
 an acknowledged receipt of the corresponding PSC-RSP from the PCP/AP provided that the PSC-RSP
 contained a status code indicating success. After receiving a PSC-RSP frame from the PCP/AP with a status
 code indicating success and responding with an acknowledgment, the STA switches to the PS mode at the
 instant specified by the BI Start Time field of the Wakeup Schedule element transmitted to the PCP/AP and
 follows the WS established with the PCP/AP.
 If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has not established a pseudo-static SP with the PCP/AP, a WS element shall be
 included in any PSC-REQ frame that the STA transmits to the PCP/AP as an explicit request for a
 wakeup schedule. If the PCP/AP accepts the proposed WS, it shall reply with a PSC-RSP frame
 indicating a status code of SUCCESS. Otherwise, it shall respond with a PSC-RSP frame with a nonzero
 status code indicating the reason for rejecting the request. The PCP/AP may suggest an alternative schedule
 in the PSC-RSP frame and set the status code to REJECT_WITH_SCHEDULE. If the STA accepts the
 alternative schedule, it shall include this WS in a subsequently transmitted PSC-REQ frame. If the non-PCP/
 non-AP STA does not accept the alternative schedule, it shall not send a PSC-REQ frame for
 dot11PSRequestSuspensionInterval beacon intervals following the receipt of the PSC-RSP frame.
 NOTE—Providing recommended schedules enables the PCP/AP to align sleep intervals from different non-PCP/non-
 AP STAs.
 If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has established a pseudo-static SP schedule with the PCP/AP, it may omit the
 WS in the PSC-REQ frames that it sends to the PCP/AP. In this case, all outstanding pseudo-static SPs for
 the non-PCP/non-AP STA become an implicit WS request. When no WS element is specified in a PSC-
 REQ, the PCP/AP shall reply with a PSC-RSP frame indicating a status code of SUCCESS and shall adopt
 all outstanding pseudo-static service period schedules (9.33.6.4) as the wakeup schedule for that STA.
 If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has explicitly established a WS with the PCP/AP and the non-PCP/non-AP STA
 is in PS mode, the non-PCP/non-AP STA shall have m successive Awake BIs repeating every n beacon
 interval, where n is the value of the Sleep Cycle field of the WS element contained in the PSC-RSP frame
 received from the PCP/AP during the frame exchange that established the WS, and m is the value of the
 Number of Awake/Doze BIs field in that PSC-RSP frame. The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall be awake during
 allocated SPs in which it is either the source or destination DMG STA during each Awake BI.
 If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has implicitly established a WS with the PCP/AP and the non-PCP/non-AP STA
 is in PS mode, every beacon interval that includes an SP for which the non-PCP/non-AP STA is either the
 source or the destination shall be an Awake BI for the non-PCP/non-AP STA. The non-PCP/non-AP STA
 shall be awake during the Awake Window within the CBAPs and during allocated SPs in which it is either
 the source or destination DMG STA during each of its Awake BIs.
 The WS established by a non-PCP/non-AP STA might contain one part that is explicitly negotiated with the
 PCP/AP and another part that is inferred from the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s pseudo-static SPs. The portion of
 the WS that is explicitly negotiated between the non-PCP/non-AP STA and the PCP/AP remains valid until
 the non-PCP/non-AP STA updates or deletes the explicit portion of the WS through a successful PSC-REQ/
 PSC-RSP exchange or until the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s association with the PCP/AP times out. The
 portion of the WS that is inferred from the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s pseudo-static SPs changes with the
 changing allocation of the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s pseudo-static SPs and is deleted when the association
 with the PCP/AP times out or when an explicit deletion request for the SP is successful.

A PCP/AP may send an unsolicited PSC-RSP frame without a WS and indicating a status code of success to
a non-PCP/non-AP STA in PS mode. Upon receiving the unsolicited PSC-RSP frame meeting these
conditions, the non-PCP/non-AP STA shall switch to Active mode.
10.2.5.2.4 Power management mode operation of a non-PCP/non-AP STA with or without a
wakeup schedule
A non-PCP/non-AP STA in PS mode shall stay awake for dot11MinBHIDuration starting from the
beginning of each Awake BI and may switch to the Doze state after the expiration of this time. The only
exception is when the Power Save Configuration Response or Probe Response frame received from the PCP/
AP includes an Antenna Sector ID Pattern element, in which case the non-PCP/non-AP STA may use the
Antenna Sector ID Pattern element to receive DMG Beacon frames transmitted through a specific DMG
antenna and sector, and may switch to Doze state during other periods in the BTI.
A PCP/AP shall transmit SP allocation announcements for STAs in PS mode during each of the STAs’
Awake BIs and may transmit those SP allocation announcements in other beacon intervals. New SPs shall
be allocated to begin either within or after the later Awake BI of the source DMG STA and destination DMG
STA of the SP.
To transition from PS mode to Active mode, a non-PCP/non-AP STA that has an established WS with the
PCP/AP shall send a PSC-REQ frame with the DPM field set to 0 to the PCP/AP and enter Active mode
following the reception of the ACK response. The PCP/AP shall not send a PSC-RSP frame if the DPM field
is 0 in the PSC-REQ frame.
In order for a STA to learn the WS of another STA within the BSS, the STA may send an Information
Request frame to the other STA or to the PCP/AP as defined in 10.29.1.
If the Information Request frame is transmitted to the PCP/AP and the STA indicated in the Information
Request’s Subject Address field does not have an established WS with the PCP/AP, the PCP/AP shall set the
length of the Wakeup Schedule element to 0 in the Information Response frame. Every time the STA
indicated in the Information Request’s Subject Address field changes its WS with the PCP/AP, the PCP/AP
shall inform the STA that requested the information by transmitting an unsolicited Information Response
frame with the updated Wakeup Schedule element.
There might be one or more CBAPs in a beacon interval. An Awake window is present within the first
CBAP of a beacon interval if the Awake Window field in the Awake Window element (8.4.2.139) has a
value that is nonzero. The Awake window starts from the beginning of the first CBAP and has a duration
that is defined by the value of the Awake Window field in the Awake Window element. During the Awake
window, a STA shall transmit only ATIM frames. A DMG STA in PS mode shall be in the Awake state
during each Awake window that lies within each Awake BI for that STA.
Group addressed MSDUs, individually addressed MSDUs and MMPDUs that are to be transmitted to a STA
that is in PS mode are first announced through ATIM frames during the Awake window. A STA in PS mode
that is awake during an Awake window shall listen for these announcements to determine if it needs to
remain in the Awake state. If during the Awake window the STA does not receive or transmit an ATIM
frame with BSSID equal to the BSSID of the BSS the STA is a member, then it may enter the Doze state at
the end of the Awake window. If a STA receives an ATIM frame during the Awake Window, it shall
acknowledge the ATIM frame. Any two STAs that successfully complete an ATIM frame exchange with
each other during the Awake Window become peer STAs. If a STA receives or transmits an ATIM frame
during the Awake Window, it shall be awake during the CBAP(s) within the current beacon interval that
have the source AID or destination AID described by the ATIM frame to wait for the announced MSDU(s)
and/or MMPDU(s) to be received and/or to transmit announced MSDU(s) and/or MMPDU(s). A STA that
receives or transmits an ATIM frame during the Awake Window may enter the Doze state when it has
successfully transmitted to and received from all corresponding peer STAs for this beacon interval a QoS

 10.2.5.3 PCP Power management mode
 A PCP in PPS mode (PPS PCP) may enter the Doze state for one or more consecutive beacon intervals in
 order to minimize its energy consumption. Figure 10-5b illustrates a finite state machine that shows the state
 transition of the PCP power management mode.
            Figure 10-5b—State Transition Diagram of PCP Power Management Mode
 To enter PS mode, the PCP shall announce the start of the first PCP Doze BI and the length of the PCP sleep
 interval through the Wakeup Schedule element (8.4.2.133) and include this element within DMG Beacon or
 Announce frames. The Wakeup Schedule element shall be transmitted at least dot11MaxLostBeacons times
 before the PCP goes into PS mode. The PCP enters PS mode at the instant specified by the value of the BI
 Start Time field of the corresponding Wakeup Schedule element. In order to transition from PS mode to
 active mode, the PCP shall stop including Wakeup Schedule elements in DMG Beacon and Announce
 frames.
 In a PCP Doze BI, the PCP shall transmit an Announce frame during the ATI to each associated STA.
 The PCP may include in the Extended Schedule element the schedule for the beacon intervals during the
 PCP Doze BIs. The PCP may schedule a SP or CBAP within a Doze BI by setting the Allocation Start field
 of the new SP or CBAP in the Extended Schedule element to a value within a Doze BI. If the Extended
 Schedule element is transmitted, the PCP shall transmit it at least dot11MaxLostBeacons times before the
 PPS PCP enters the Doze state.

The PCP shall check that the schedule of pseudo-static allocations transmitted in the last Extended Schedule
element before the PCP entered PS mode is valid during the PCP Doze BIs. Thus, a STA participating in
such a pseudo-static allocation assumes that the allocation is present during the following consecutive PCP
Doze BIs.
The PCP may enter and remain in the Doze state for any portion of an SP if it is not a source or a destination
of the SP. The PCP shall remain in the Awake state for any portion of a truncatable or extendable SP
(8.4.2.134). The availability of the PCP during a CBAP in the Awake BI shall be announced by setting the
PCP Active subfield within the Allocation Control field to one for a CBAP allocation made through the
Extended Schedule element.
Figure 10-5c shows an example of the basic operation of a PCP in PPS mode when the PCP sleep interval
equals one beacon interval (i.e., PCP sleeps every other beacon interval) and the PCP sleep interval starts
right after the first beacon interval. In this example, the first beacon interval and the second beacon interval
have the same schedule, but the third beacon interval and the fourth beacon interval have different
schedules. The first beacon interval is the Awake BI in which the PPS PCP is in the Awake state to serve
non-PCP STAs. In the first beacon interval, the PCP transmits the Extended Schedule element for the
current beacon interval with the pseudo-static subfield set to 1 for all allocations within the Extended
Schedule element to indicate that the schedule of the first beacon interval also applies to the second beacon
interval. In addition, the PCP transmits the Wakeup Schedule element with the information of the start time
and the length of the PCP sleep interval, and the STA Availability element to indicate the availability of the
PCP for the CBAP of the Awake BI. Following the CBAP of the first beacon interval, the PCP enters the
Doze state and sleeps for more than one beacon interval. The PCP switches from the Doze state to the
Awake state after sleeping through the remainder of the first beacon interval and through the entire second
beacon interval, which is the start of the third beacon interval in Figure 10-5c. Since in this example the
schedule of the third beacon interval and the fourth beacon interval are different, the PCP transmits the
Extended Schedule element containing the individual allocations for the third beacon interval and fourth
beacon interval. The PCP enters the Doze state after it completes all exchanges in the third beacon interval
and wakes up at the start of the fifth beacon interval.

to the STA state. In State 1, only Class 1 frames are allowed. In State 2, either Class 1 or Class 2 frames are
allowed. In State 3 and State 4, all frames are allowed (Classes 1, 2, and 3).
In the definition of frame classes, the following terms are used:
   —     Within an infrastructure BSS: both the transmitting STA and the recipient STA participate in the
         same infrastructure BSS
   —     Within a PBSS: both the transmitting STA and the recipient STA participate in the same PBSS
   —     Within an IBSS: both the transmitting STA and the recipient STA participate in the same IBSS
   —     dot11RSNAEnabled: reference to the setting of dot11RSNAEnabled at the STA that needs to
         determine whether a transmission or reception is permitted.
NOTE—The phrase “within a BSS” comprises “within a PBSS,” “within an IBSS,” “within a MBSS,” or “within an
infrastructure BSS.”
STA A participates in the same infrastructure BSS as STA B if at least one of the following conditions is
met:
   —     STA A is associated with STA B, and either STA A or STA B is an AP.
   —     STA A receives a frame with the value of its TA field equal to the MAC address of STA B and with
         the value of its BSSID field equal to the BSSID of the BSS with which STA A is associated.
   —     STA A receives an Information Response frame from the AP with which it is associated containing
         an explicit indication that STA B is a member of the BSS with which STA A is associated.
STA A participates in the same PBSS as STA B if at least one of the following conditions is met:
   —     STA A is associated with STA B, and either STA A or STA B is a PCP.
   —     STA A receives a frame with the value of its TA field equal to the MAC address of STA B and with
         the value of its BSSID field equal to the BSSID of the PBSS that STA A has joined or started.
   —     STA A receives a frame, i.e. an Information Response frame, from its PCP containing an explicit
         indication that STA B is a member of the PBSS that STA A has joined.
STA A participates in the same IBSS as STA B if STA A receives a frame with the value of its TA field
equal to the MAC address of STA B and with the value of its BSSID field equal to the BSSID of the IBSS
that STA A has joined or started.
The frame classes are defined as follows:
   a)    Class 1 frames
         1)    Control frames
               i)   RTS
               ii)  DMG Clear to send (DMG CTS)

Class 2 and Class 3 frames are not allowed in an IBSS. If a STA in an IBSS receives a Class 2 or Class 3
frame, it shall ignore the frame.
A STA shall not transmit Class 2 frames unless in State 2 or State 3 or State 4.
A STA shall not transmit Class 3 frames unless in State 3 or State 4.
A multi-band capable device that uses OCT to move from State 2 to either State 3 or State 4 shall not
transmit frames before the transmitting STA becomes on-the-air enabled (see 10.32.4).
The use of the word “receive” in 10.3 refers to a frame that meets all of the filtering criteria specified in
Clause 11 and Clause 9.
10.3.4 Authentication and deauthentication
10.3.4.1 General
Change 10.3.4.1 as follows:
This subclause describes the procedures used for IEEE 802.11 authentication and deauthentication. The
states used in this description are defined in 10.3.1.
Successful authentication sets the STA’s state to State 2, if it was in State 1. Unsuccessful authentication
leaves the STA’s state unchanged. The STA shall not transmit Class 2 frames unless in State 2 or State 3 or
State 4. The STA shall not transmit Class 3 frames unless in State 3 or State 4.
Deauthentication notification sets the STA’s state to State 1. The STA shall become authenticated again
prior to sending Class 2 frames. Deauthentication notification when in State 3 or State 4 implies
disassociation as well. A STA may deauthenticate a peer STA at any time, for any reason.
If non-DMG STA A in an infrastructure BSS receives a Class 2 or Class 3 frame from STA B that is not
authenticated with STA A (i.e., the state for STA B is State 1), STA A shall discard the frame. If the frame
has an individual address in the Address 1 field, the MLME of STA A shall send a Deauthentication frame
to STA B.
Authentication is optional in an non-DMG IBSS. In an non-DMG infrastructure BSS, authentication is
required. APs do not initiate authentication. Authentication and deauthentication are not supported by DMG
STAs.
10.3.4.2 Authentication—originating STA
Insert the following paragraph at the beginning of 10.3.4.2:
Upon receipt of an MLME-AUTHENTICATE.request primitive that is part of an on-channel tunneling (see
10.32.4), the originating STA shall follow the rules in 10.32.4 in addition to the authentication procedure
described below.

 10.3.5 Association, reassociation, and disassociation
 Change 10.3.5.1 to 10.3.5.9 as follows:
 10.3.5.1 General
 Subclause 10.3.5 describes the procedures used for IEEE 802.11 association, reassociation, and
 disassociation.
 The states used in this description are defined in 10.3.1.
 Successful association enables a STA to exchange Class 3 frames. Successful association sets the STA’s
 state to State 3 or State 4.
 Successful reassociation enables a STA to exchange Class 3 frames. Unsuccessful reassociation when not in
 State 1 leaves the STA’s state unchanged (with respect to the PCP/AP that was sent the Reassociation
 Request (which may be the current STA)). Successful reassociation sets the STA’s state to State 3 or State 4
 (with respect to the PCP/AP that was sent the Reassociation Request). Successful reassociation when not in
 State 1 sets the STA’s state to State 2 (with respect to the current PCP/AP, if this is not the PCP/AP that was
 sent the Reassociation Request). Reassociation shall be performed only if the originating STA is already
 associated in the same ESS.
 Disassociation notification when not in State 1 sets the STA’s state to State 2. The STA shall become
 associated again prior to sending Class 3 frames. A STA may disassociate a peer STA at any time, for any
 reason.
 If non-DMG STA A in an infrastructure BSS receives a Class 3 frame from STA B that is authenticated but
 not associated with STA A (i.e., the state for STA B is State 2), STA A shall discard the frame. If the frame
 has an individual address in the Address 1 field, the MLME of STA A shall send a Disassociation frame to
 STA B.
 If DMG STA A in an infrastructure BSS receives a Class 3 frame from STA B that is not associated with
 STA A (i.e., the state for STA B is State 2), STA A shall discard the frame. If the frame has an individual
 address in the Address 1 field, the MLME of STA A shall send a Disassociation frame to STA B.
 If an MM-SME coordinated STA receives an Association Response frame with a result code equal to
 SUCCESS and with the value of the Single AID field within MMS element equal to 1, then
    —     For each of its MAC entities advertised within the MMS element and for which dot11RSNAEnabled
          is true, the state is set to State 3. Progress from State 3 to State 4 occurs independently in each such
          MAC entity.
    —     For each of its MAC entities advertised within the MMS element and for which dot11RSNAEnabled
          is false, the state is set to State 4.
 If the MM-SME coordinated STA in State 3 is assigned an AID for only the MAC entity identified by the
 RA field of the Association Response with result code equal to SUCCESS, the MM-SME may repeat the
 association procedure for any other MAC entity coordinated by the MM-SME.
 Association is not applicable in an IBSS. In an infrastructure BSS, association is required. In a PBSS,
 association is optional. APs do not initiate association.

10.3.5.2 Non-PCP/Non-AP STA association initiation procedures
The SME shall delete any PTKSA and temporal keys held for communication with the PCP/AP by using
MLME-DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15) before invoking MLME-ASSOCIATE.request
primitive.
If dot11InterworkingServiceActivated is true, the STA does not have credentials for the AP, and the STA is
initiating an emergency services association procedure, the SME shall submit the
MLMEASSOCIATE.request with EmergencyServices parameter set to true.
The MM-SME of a non-PCP/non-AP STA may include an MMS element in an MLME-
ASSOCIATE.request primitive. The MM-SME shall include in the MMS element the MAC address
associated with the MLME SAP instance to which the primitive is submitted.
Upon receipt of an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive that is part of an on-channel tunneling (see
10.32.4), a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall follow the rules in 10.32.4 in addition to the association procedures
described below.
Upon receipt of an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall associate with an
PCP/AP using the following procedure:
   a)    If the state for the AP is State 1, the MLME shall inform the SME of the failure of the association by
         issuing an MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm primitive, and this procedure ends.
   b)    The MLME shall transmit an Association Request frame to the PCP/AP. If the MLME-
         ASSOCIATE.request primitive contained an RSNE with only one pairwise cipher suite and only
         one authenticated key suite, this RSNE shall be included in the Association Request frame. If the
         MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive contained the EmergencyServices parameter set to true, an
         Interworking element with the UESA field set to 1 shall be included in the Association Request
         frame.
   c)    If an Association Response frame is received with a status code of Successful, the state for the PCP/
         AP shall be set to State 4 or State 3 if RSNA Establishment is required. The state for any other PCP/
         AP which is State 3 or State 4 prior to the association request shall be set to State 2, and the MLME
         shall issue an MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm primitive to inform the SME of the successful
         completion of the association.
   d)    An MM-SME coordinated STA that receives an Association Response frame with a status code of
         Successful containing an MLME element with the Single AID field equal to 1, all the STAs
         coordinated by the MM-SME are associated with the PCP/AP (i.e., shall be set to State 4 or State 3
         if RSNA Establishment is required).
   e)    d) If an Association Response frame is received with a status code other than Successful or the
         AssociateFailureTimeout expires, the state for the PCP/AP shall be set to State 2, and the MLME
         shall issue an MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm primitive to inform the SME of the failure of the
         association. The status code returned in the Association Response frame indicates the cause of the
         failed association attempt. Any misconfiguration or parameter mismatch, e.g., data rates required as
         basic rates that the STA did not indicate as supported in the STA’s Supported Rates element, shall
         be corrected before the SME issues an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same PCP/
         AP. If the status code indicates the association failed because of a reason that is not related to
         configuration (e.g., the PCP/AP is unable to support additional associations) and the Association
         Response frame does not include a Timeout Interval element with Timeout Interval Type equal to 3,
         the SME shall not issue an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same PCP/AP until a
         period of at least 2 s has elapsed. If the status code indicates the association failed and the
         Association Response frame contains a Timeout Interval element with Timeout Interval Type equal
         to 3, the SME shall not issue an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same PCP/AP until
         the period specified in the Timeout Interval element has elapsed.

   f)     e) If an MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm primitive is received with a ResultCode of SUCCESS and if
          RSNA is required, then the SME shall perform a 4-way handshake to establish an RSNA. As a part
          of a successful 4-way handshake, the SME enables protection by invoking an MLME-
          SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx) primitive.
   g)     f) Upon receipt of the MLME-SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx) primitive, the MLME shall set
          the state of the STA to State 4.
 10.3.5.3 PCP/AP association receipt procedures
 Upon receipt of an Association Request frame from a non-AP STA for which the state is State 1, the AP’s
 MLME shall transmit an Association Response frame with an appropriate status code.
 Upon receipt of an Association Request frame from a non-PCP/non-AP STA for which the state is State 2,
 State 3, or State 4, the PCP/AP’s MLME shall associate with the non-PCP/non-AP STA using the following
 procedure:
   a)     The MLME shall issue an MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication primitive to inform the SME of the
          association request.
   b)     At an AP having dot11InterworkingServiceActivated equal to true, subsequent to receiving an
          MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication primitive with EmergencyServices set to true that does not include
          an RSNE, the SME shall accept the association request even if dot11RSNAActivated is true and
          dot11PrivacyInvoked is true thereby granting access, using unprotected frames (see 8.2.4.1.9), to the
          network for emergency services purposes.
   c)     Upon receiving an MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication primitive, when management frame protection
          is not in use, the SME shall delete any PTKSA and temporal keys held for communication with the
          STA by using the MLME-DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15).
   d)     In an RSNA, the PCP/AP shall check the values received in the RSNE to see whether the values
          received match the PCP/AP’s security policy. If not, the association shall not be accepted.
   e)     If the PCP/AP’s state for the non-PCP/non-AP STA is State 4, the PCP/AP has a valid security
          association for the non-PCP/non-AP STA and has negotiated management frame protection with the
          non-PCP/non-AP STA, and an earlier, timed-out SA Query procedure with the non-PCP/non-AP
          STA has not allowed a new association process to be started without an additional SA Query
          procedure, then
          1)    The SME shall reject the Association Request by generating an MLME-ASSOCIATE.response
                primitive with ResultCode “Association request rejected temporarily; try again later.”
          2)    The SME shall not modify any association state for the non-PCP/non-AP STA and shall
                include in the MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive a Timeout Interval element with
                Timeout interval type set to 3 (Association Comeback time), specifying a comeback time when
                the PCP/AP would be ready to accept an association with this STA.
          3)    Following this, if the SME is not already engaging in an SA Query with the STA, the SME
                shall issue one MLME-SAQuery.request primitive addressed to the STA every
                dot11AssociationSAQueryRetryTimeout TUs until a matching MLME-SAQuery.confirm
                primitive is received or dot11AssociationSAQueryMaximumTimeout TUs from the beginning
                of the SA Query procedure have passed.
          4)    The SME shall specify a TransactionIdentifier parameter value in the MLME-SAQuery.request
                primitive, increment the value by 1 for each subsequent MLME-SAQuery.request primitive,
                and roll over the value to 0 after the maximum allowed value is reached.
          5)    The MLME may interpret reception of a valid protected frame as an indication of a
                successfully completed SA Query and thereby generate an MLME-SAQuery.confirm
                primitive.

         6)    If an MLME-SAQuery.confirm primitive with an outstanding transaction identifier is not
               received within dot11AssociationSAQueryMaximumTimeout period, the SME shall allow the
               association process to be started without starting an additional SA Query procedure.
   f)    The SME shall refuse an association request from a STA that does not support all the rates in the
         BSSBasicRateSet parameter
   g)    The SME shall refuse an association request from an HT STA that does not support all the MCSs in
         the BSSBasicMCSSet parameter.
   h)    The SME shall generate an MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive addressed to the non-PCP/non-
         AP STA. When the association is not successful, the SME shall indicate a specific reason for the
         failure to associate in the ResultCode parameter as defined in 6.3.7.5.2. If the ResultCode is
         SUCCESS, the SME has an existing SA with the non-PCP/non-AP STA, and an SA Query
         procedure with that non-PCP/non-AP STA has failed to receive a valid response, then the SME shall
         send an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive to the STA with Reason Code “Previous
         Authentication no longer valid.”40 If the ResultCode is SUCCESS, the association identifier
         assigned to the STA shall be included in the MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive, and the SME
         shall delete any PTKSA and temporal keys held for communication with the STA by using the
         MLME-DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15). In the case of a DMG PCP/AP, the
         association identifier shall be in the range of 1 to 254.
   i)    If the MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication primitive includes an MMS parameter, the PCP/AP shall
         generate the MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive directed to the MLME of the STA identified
         by the PeerSTAAddress parameter of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive and take the
         following additional action, as appropriate:
         1)    If the Single AID field in the MMS parameter of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication primitive
               is equal to 1, the PCP/AP may allocate a single AID for all the STAs included in the MMS
               element. If the PCP/AP allocates the same AID to each STA whose MAC address was included
               in the MMS element, it shall include the MMS element received from the MM-SME
               coordinated STA in the MLME-ASSOCIATION.response primitive.
         2)    If the Single AID field is 0, the AP shall allocate a distinct AID for each STA specified in the
               MMS element.
   j)    i) Upon receipt of an MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive, the MLME shall transmit an
         Association Response frame to the STA.
   k)    j) When the ResultCode of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive is not SUCCESS, if
         management frame protection is in use, the state for the STA shall be left unchanged and, if
         management frame protection is not in use, set to State 3 if it was in State 4.
   l)    k) When the Association Response frame with a status code of Successful is acknowledged by the
         STA, the state for the STA shall be set to State 4 or to State 3 if RSNA establishment is required.
   m)    l) If RSNA establishment is required, the SME shall attempt a 4-way handshake. Upon a successful
         completion of a 4-way handshake, the SME shall enable protection by invoking an MLME-
         SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx)                primitive.        Upon         receipt       of      the     MLME-
         SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx) primitive, the MLME shall set the state for the STA to State 4.
   n)    m) AP only: The SME shall inform the DS of any changes in the association state.
10.3.5.4 Non-PCP/Non-AP STA reassociation initiation procedures
Except when the association is part of a fast BSS transition, the SME shall delete any PTKSA and temporal
keys held for communication with the PCP/AP by using the MLME-DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see
11.5.15) before invoking an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive.

Std 802.11ad-2012                                LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 If dot11InterworkingServiceActivated is true and the STA was associated to the ESS for unsecured access to
 emergency services, the SME shall submit the MLME-REASSOCIATE.request with EmergencyServices
 parameter set to true.
 The MM-SME of a non-PCP/non-AP STA may include an MMS element in an MLME-
 REASSOCIATE.request primitive. The MM-SME shall include in the MMS element the MAC address
 associated with the MLME SAP instance to which the primitive is submitted.
 Upon receipt of an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive that is part of an on-channel tunneling (see
 10.32.4), a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall follow the rules in 10.32.4 in addition to the reassociation
 procedures described below.
 Upon receipt of an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall reassociate
 with a PCP/AP using the following procedure:
    a)   If the STA is not associated in the same ESS or the state for the new AP is State 1, the MLME shall
         inform the SME of the failure of the reassociation by issuing an MLME-REASSOCIATE.confirm
         primitive, and this procedure ends.
    b)   The MLME shall transmit a Reassociation Request frame to the new PCP/AP. If the MLME-
         REASSOCIATE.request primitive contained an RSNE with only one pairwise cipher suite and only
         one authenticated key suite, this RSNE shall be included in the Reassociation Request frame. If the
         MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive contained the EmergencyServices parameter set to true,
         an Interworking element with the UESA field set to 1 shall be included in the Reassociation Request
         frame.
    c)   If a Reassociation Response frame is received with a status code of Successful, the state variable for
         the new PCP/AP shall be set to State 4 or to State 3 if RSNA establishment is required and the FT
         Protocol is not used with respect to the new PCP/AP and, unless the old PCP/AP and new PCP/AP
         are the same, to State 2 with respect to the old PCP/AP, and the MLME shall issue an MLME-
         REASSOCIATE.confirm primitive to inform the SME of the successful completion of the
         reassociation.
    d)   An MM-SME coordinated STA that receives a Reassociation Response frame with a status code of
         Successful containing an MLME element with the Single AID field equal to 1, all the STAs
         coordinated by the MM-SME are reassociated with the PCP/AP (i.e., shall be set to State 4 or State
         3 if RSNA Establishment is required).
    e)   d) If a Reassociation Response frame is received with a status code other than Successful or the
         ReassociateFailureTimeout expires,
         1)    Except when the association is part of a fast BSS transition, the state for the PCP/AP shall be
               set to State 2 with respect to the new PCP/AP.
         2)    The MLME shall issue an MLME-REASSOCIATE.confirm primitive to inform the SME of
               the failure of the reassociation. The ResultCode returned in the MLME-
               REASSOCIATE.confirm primitive indicates the cause of the failed reassociation attempt. Any
               misconfiguration or parameter mismatch, e.g., data rates required as basic rates that the STA
               did not indicate as supported in the STA’s Supported Rates element, shall be corrected before
               the SME issues an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same PCP/AP. If the
               status code indicates the reassociation failed because of a reason that is not related to
               configuration (e.g., the PCP/AP is unable to support additional associations) and the
               Reassociation Response frame does not include a Timeout Interval element with Timeout
               Interval Type equal to 3, the SME shall not issue an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive
               for the same PCP/AP until a period of at least 2 s has elapsed. If the status code indicates the
               reassociation failed and the Reassociation Response frame contains a Timeout Interval element
               with Timeout Interval Type equal to 3, the SME shall not issue an MLME-
               REASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same PCP/AP until the period specified in the
               Timeout Interval element has elapsed.

   f)   e) If an MLME-REASSOCIATE.confirm primitive is received with a ResultCode of SUCCESS,
        RSNA is required, and the STA is in State 3, then the SME shall perform a 4-way handshake to
        establish an RSNA. As a part of a successful 4-way handshake, the SME shall enable protection by
        invoking an MLME-SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx) primitive.
   g)   f) Upon receipt of the MLME-SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx) primitive, the MLME shall set
        the state of the STA to State 4.
10.3.5.5 PCP/AP STA reassociation receipt procedures
Upon receipt of an Reassociation Request frame from a non-AP STA for which the state is State 1, the AP’s
MLME shall transmit an Reassociation Response frame with an appropriate status code.
Upon receipt of a Reassociation Request frame from a STA for which the state is State 2, State 3, or State 4,
the PCP/AP’s MLME shall reassociate with the STA using the following procedure:
   a)   The MLME shall issue an MLME-REASSOCIATE.indication primitive to inform the SME of the
        reassociation request.
   b)   At an AP having dot11InterworkingServiceActivated equal to true, subsequent to receiving a
        MLME-REASSOCIATE.indication primitive with EmergencyServices set to true that does not
        include an RSN parameter, the SME shall accept the reassociation request even if
        dot11RSNAActivated is true and dot11PrivacyInvoked is true thereby granting access, using
        unprotected frames (see 8.2.4.1.9), to the network for emergency services purposes.
   c)   In an RSNA, the SME shall check the values received in the RSNE to see whether the values
        received match the AP’s security policy. If not, the association shall not be accepted.
   d)   If the PCP/AP’s state for the non-PCP/non-AP STA is State 4, the non-PCP/non-AP STA has a valid
        security association, the non-PCP/non-AP STA has negotiated management frame protection, the
        reassociation is not a part of a Fast BSS Transition, and an earlier, timed-out SA Query procedure
        with the non-PCP/non-AP STA has not allowed a new association process to be started without an
        additional SA Query procedure, then
        1)    The SME shall reject the Reassociation Request by generating an MLME-
              REASSOCIATE.response primitive with ResultCode “Association request rejected
              temporarily; Try again later.”
        2)    The SME shall not modify any association state for the non-PCP/non-AP STA and shall
              include in the MLME-REASSOCIATE.response primitive a Timeout Interval element with
              type set to 3 (Association Comeback time), specifying a comeback time when the PCP/AP
              would be ready to accept an association with this STA.
        3)    Following this, if the SME is not in an ongoing SA Query with the STA, the SME shall issue
              one      MLME-SAQuery.request          primitive      addressed     to    the     STA      every
              dot11AssociationSAQueryRetryTimeout TUs until a matching MLME-SAQuery.confirm
              primitive is received or dot11AssociationSAQueryMaximumTimeout TUs from the beginning
              of the SA Query procedure have passed.
        4)    The SME shall insert the TransactionIdentifier in MLME-SAQuery.request primitive,
              increment this by 1 for each subsequent MLME-SAQuery.request primitive, and roll it over to
              0 after the maximum allowed value in this field.
        5)    An MLME may interpret reception of a valid protected frame as an indication of a successfully
              completed SA Query and thereby generate an MLME-SAQuery.confirm primitive.
        6)    If an MLME-SAQuery.confirm primitive with an outstanding transaction identifier is not
              received within dot11AssociationSAQueryMaximumTimeout period, the SME shall allow the
              association process to be started without starting an additional SA Query procedure.
   e)   The SME shall refuse a reassociation request from a STA that does not support all the rates in the
        BSSBasicRateSet parameter.

    f)   The SME shall refuse a reassociation request from an HT STA that does not support all the MCSs in
         the BSSBasicMCSSet parameter.
    g)   The SME shall generate an MLME-REASSOCIATE.response primitive addressed to the non-PCP/
         non-AP STA. If the reassociation is not successful, the SME shall indicate a specific reason for the
         failure to reassociate in the ResultCode parameter as defined in 6.3.7.5.2.
    h)   If the ResultCode is SUCCESS, the SME has an existing SA with the non-PCP/non-AP STA, and an
         SA Query procedure with that non-PCP/non-AP STA has failed to receive a valid response, then the
         SME shall issue an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive with Reason Code “Previous
         Authentication no longer valid.”
         NOTE—This MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive generates a protected Disassociation frame
         addressed to the STA.
    i)   If the ResultCode is SUCCESS, the association identifier assigned to the STA shall be included in
         this primitive. If the association is not part of a fast BSS transition and management frame protection
         is not in use, the SME shall delete any PTKSA and temporal keys held for communication with the
         STA by using MLME-DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15). In the case of a DMG PCP/
         AP, the association identifier shall be in the range of 1 to 254.
    j)   If the MLME-REASSOCIATE.indication primitive includes an MMS parameter, the PCP/AP shall
         generate the MLME-REASSOCIATE.response primitive directed to the MLME of the STA
         identified by the PeerSTAAddress parameter of the MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive and
         take the following additional action, as appropriate:
         1)    If the Single AID field in the MMS parameter of the MLME-REASSOCIATE.indication
               primitive is equal to 1, the PCP/AP may allocate a single AID for all the STAs included in the
               MMS element. If the PCP/AP allocates the same AID to all STAs whose MAC address was
               included in the MMS element, it shall include the MMS element received from the MM-SME
               coordinated STA in the MLME-REASSOCIATE.response primitive.
         2)    If the Single AID field is 0, the AP shall allocate a distinct AID for each STA specified in the
               MMS element.
    k)   j) Upon receipt of an MLME-REASSOCIATE.response primitive, the MLME shall transmit a
         Reassociation Response frame to the STA.
    l)   k) When the Reassociation Response frame with a status value of Successful is acknowledged by the
         STA, the state variable for the STA shall be set to State 4 or to State 3 if RSNA establishment is
         required on the new PCP/AP and the FT Protocol is not used on the new PCP/AP.
    m)   l) When the ResultCode of the reassociation is not SUCCESS, and if Management Frame Protection
         is in use, the state for the STA shall be left unchanged on the PCP/AP to which the Reassociation
         Request frame was sent. When the ResultCode is not SUCCESS, Management Frame Protection is
         not in use, and the association is not part of a fast BSS transition, then the state for the STA is set to
         State 3 if it was in State 4.
    n)   m) If RSNA establishment is required and FT is not in use, the SME shall attempt a 4-way
         handshake. Upon a successful completion of a 4-way handshake, the SME shall enable protection by
         invoking an MLME-SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx) primitive. Upon receipt of the MLME-
         SETPROTECTION.request(Rx_Tx) primitive, the MLME shall set the state for the STA to State 4.
    o)   n) AP only: The SME shall inform the DS of any changes in the association state.
 10.3.5.6 Non-PCP/Non-AP STA disassociation initiation procedures
 The SME shall issue an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive that includes an appropriate Reason
 Code as defined in Table 8-36 of 8.4.1.7.
 Upon receipt of an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive, a non-PCP/non-AP STA’s MLME shall
 disassociate from a PCP/AP using the following procedure:

   a)    If the state for the PCP/AP is State 3 or State 4, the MLME shall transmit a Disassociation frame to
         the PCP/AP.
   b)    The state for the PCP/AP shall be set to State 2 if it was not State 1. In the case of an MM-SME
         coordinated STA, the MLME shall perform this for each STA whose address was included in the
         MMS parameter of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.request or MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive
         that established the association.
   c)    The MLME shall issue an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.confirm primitive to inform the SME of the
         successful completion of the disassociation.
   d)    Upon receiving a MLME-DISASSOCIATE.confirm primitive, the SME shall delete any PTKSA
         and temporal keys held for communication with the PCP/AP by using the MLME-
         DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15) and by invoking an MLME-
         SETPROTECTION.request(None) primitive. In the case of an MM-SME coordinated STA, the
         MLME shall perform this for each STA whose address was included in the MMS parameter of the
         MLME-ASSOCIATE.request or MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive that established the
         association.
10.3.5.7 Non-PCP/Non-AP STA disassociation receipt procedures
Upon receipt of a Disassociation frame from an PCP/AP for which the state is State 3 or State 4, if
Management Frame Protection was not negotiated when the PTKSA(s) were created, or if MFP is in use and
the frame is not discarded per MFP processing, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall disassociate from the PCP/AP
using the following procedure:
   a)    The state for the PCP/AP shall be set to State 2.
   b)    The MLME shall issue an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.indication primitive to inform the SME of the
         disassociation.
   c)    Upon receiving the MLME-DISASSOCIATE.indication primitive, the SME shall delete any
         PTKSA and temporal keys held for communication with the PCP/AP by using the MLME-
         DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15) and by invoking an MLME-
         SETPROTECTION.request(None) primitive. The MM-SME shall perform this process for each
         STA whose address was included in the MMS parameter of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.request or
         MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive that established the association.
   d)    If the reason code indicates a configuration or parameter mismatch as the cause of the
         disassociation, the SME shall not attempt to associate or reassociate with the PCP/AP until the
         configuration or parameter mismatch has been corrected.
   e)    If the reason code indicates the STA was disassociated for a reason other than configuration or
         parameter mismatch, the SME shall not attempt to associate or reassociate with the PCP/AP until a
         period of 2s has elapsed.
10.3.5.8 PCP/AP disassociation initiation procedure
The SME shall issue an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive that includes an appropriate Reason
Code as defined Table 8-36 of 8.4.1.7.
Upon receipt of an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive, an PCP/AP shall disassociate a STA using
the following procedure:
   a)    If the state for the STA is State 3 or State 4, the PCP/AP shall generate a Disassociation frame to be
         transmitted to the indicated STA.
         NOTE—As the Disassociation frame is a bufferable MMPDU, the transmission of this frame might be delayed
         by the operation of a power-saving protocol. The AID and the PTKSA are maintained (when applicable) until
         the frame is acknowledged or attempts to transmit the frame are abandoned.

         process for each STA whose address was included in the MMS parameter of the MLME-
         ASSOCIATE.request or MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive that established the association.
    c)   Once the Disassociation frame is acknowledged or attempts to transmit the frame are abandoned, the
         MLME shall issue an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.confirm primitive to inform the SME of the
         disassociation.
    d)   Upon receiving a MLME-DISASSOCIATE.confirm primitive, the SME shall delete any PTKSA
         and temporal keys held for communication with the STA by using the MLME-
         DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15) and by invoking an MLME-
         SETPROTECTION.request(None) primitive. The MM-SME shall perform this process for each
         STA whose address was included in the MMS parameter of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.request or
         MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive that established the association.
    e)   Upon receiving an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.confirm primitive, the SME shall release the AID
         assigned for the indicated STA, if the state for the indicated STA was State 3 or State 4.
    f)   The SME of an AP shall inform the DS of the disassociation.
 10.3.5.9 PCP/AP disassociation receipt procedure
 Upon receipt of a Disassociation frame from a STA for which the state is State 3 or State 4, if management
 frame protection was not negotiated when the PTKSA(s) were created, or if MFP is in use and the frame is
 not discarded per MFP processing, the PCP/AP shall disassociate the STA using the following procedure:
    a)   The state for the STA shall be set to State 2. The MM-SME shall perform this process for each STA
         whose address was included in the MMS parameter of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.request or MLME-
         REASSOCIATE.request primitive that established the association.
    b)   The MLME shall issue an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.indication primitive to inform the SME of the
         disassociation.
    c)   Upon receiving a MLME-DISASSOCIATE.indication primitive the SME shall delete any PTKSA
         and temporal keys held for communication with the STA by using the MLME-
         DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15) and by invoking an MLME-
         SETPROTECTION.request(None) primitive. The MM-SME shall perform this process for each
         STA whose address was included in the MMS parameter of the MLME-ASSOCIATE.request or
         MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive that established the association.
    d)   The SME of an AP shall inform the DS of the disassociation.
    e)   The SME shall release the AID assigned for the indicated STA.
 Insert the following subclause, 10.3.5.10, after 10.3.5.9:
 10.3.5.10 PBSS procedures for nonassociated STAs
 In a PBSS, there are four types of relationships between a PCP and the members of a PBSS:
    —    Nonassociated, non-RSNA (when dot11RSNAEnabled is false)
    —    Associated, non-RSNA (when dot11RSNAEnabled is false)
    —    Associated, RSNA (when dot11RSNAEnabled is true)
    —    Nonassociated, RSNA (when dot11RSNAEnabled is true)
 The following rules apply in the last case:
    a)   In a PBSS, when in State 2 and dot11RSNAEnabled is set to true, successful RSNA establishment

10.3.6 Additional mechanisms for an AP collocated with a mesh STA
Insert the following subclause, 10.3.7, after 10.3.6:
10.3.7 Communicating PBSS information
Following the association or security association of a STA with a PCP, the PCP shall send the PBSS
information using an unsolicited Information Response frame (8.5.20.5). The PCP shall set the Subject
Address field of the Information Response frame to the broadcast address and shall include in the
Information Response frame an entry for each STA associated with the PBSS including the PCP.
The PCP shall distribute the PBSS information for each of the STAs that are associated with the PBSS,
including the PCP, at least once every dot11BroadcastSTAInfoDuration beacon intervals.
10.4 TS operation
10.4.1 Introduction
Change 10.4.1 as follows:
There are three types of traffic specifications: the TSPEC, the DMG TSPEC, and the PTP TSPEC.
A TSPEC describes the traffic characteristics and the QoS requirements of a TS. The main purpose of the
TSPEC is to reserve resources within the HC and, in the case of HCCA and HEMM access policies, to
modify the HC’s scheduling behavior. It also allows other parameters to be specified that are associated with
the TS, such as a traffic classifier and acknowledgment policy.
The DMG TSPEC (8.4.2.136) describes an allocation (also known as DMG allocation) within either a PBSS
or a DMG infrastructure BSS. The purpose of the DMG TSPEC is to create or modify an allocation for the
transmission of frames between DMG STAs that are members of a PBSS or that are members of an
infrastructure BSS (9.33.6).
When transmitted between DMG STAs of a PBSS or DMG STAs of an infrastructure BSS, the TSPEC
defined in 8.4.2.32 is used to create or modify a TS between members. When transmitted between DMG
STAs of a PBSS or between DMG STAs of an infrastructure BSS, the TSPEC is referred to as a PTP
TSPEC.
In a DMG BSS, a TSPEC includes parameters that are associated with the TS such as maximum MSDU
size, delay bound, and optionally the allocation carrying the TS. A single allocation can carry multiple TSs.
Each TS is carried in one allocation, except when
   —     The TS has an access policy of EDCA, where it can use all CBAP allocations with Source AID
         equal to the broadcast AID, all CBAP allocations with Source AID matching the source STA of the
         TS, and all CBAP allocations with Destination AID matching the destination STA of the TS; or
   —     The TS has an access policy of SEMM, where it can use exactly one SP allocation as well as all
         CBAP allocations with Source AID equal to the broadcast AID, all CBAP allocations with Source
         AID matching the source STA of the TS, and all CBAP allocations with Destination AID matching
         the destination STA of the TS.
A TS may have one or more TCLAS (within the discretion of the STA that sets up the stream) associated
with it. The DMG STA or AP uses the parameters in the TCLAS elements to filter the MSDUs belonging to
this TS for delivery as part of the TS. An Intra-Access Category Priority element may be associated with a
TS by the inclusion of an Intra-Access Category Priority element in an ADDTS Request frame. The User
Priority subfield of the Intra-Access Category Priority element shall be set to the same UP as specified in the
Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.                                                                363

 User Priority subfield of the TS Info field. If dot11AlternateEDCAActivated is true, the Alternate Queue
 subfield is used to select the appropriate EDCA transmit queue when the Access Policy subfield of the TS
 Info field in the TSPEC is EDCA or HEMM. When an Intra-Access Category Priority element is associated
 with a TS, the Drop Eligibility subfield is used to indicate the drop eligibility of the MSDUs of this TS.
 TS may have zero or one Expedited Bandwidth Request (EBR) element associated with it. An AP uses the
 parameters in the EBR to understand the precedence level requested by a non-AP STA (see V.5.4). For
 example, the precedence level may be used to convey to the AP that the requested TS is for the purposes of
 placing an emergency call. Support for precedence levels greater than 18 is optional for STAs.
 TSPEC, PTP TSPEC, optional TCLAS, optional EBR, and optional Intra-Access Category Priority elements
 are transported on the air by the ADDTS Request frame and the ADDTS Response frame and across the
 MLME SAP by the MLME-ADDTS primitives. In addition, a TS could be created if a STA sends a resource
 request to an PCP/AP prior to initiating a transition to that PCP/AP, as part of performing FST (10.32), or in
 the Reassociation Request frame to that PCP/AP.
 DMG TSPEC is transported over the air within the DMG ADDTS and across the MLME SAP by the
 MLME-ADDTS primitives.
 Following a successful negotiation, a TS is created, identified within the non-AP STA by its TSID and
 direction, and identified within the HC by a combination of TSID, direction, and STA address.
 Following a successful negotiation of a DMG TSPEC in a PBSS or in a DMG infrastructure BSS, a new
 allocation is created, or an existing allocation is modified. Within a PBSS or infrastructure BSS, each
 allocation is uniquely identified by a combination of Allocation ID, source AID, and destination AID.
 Following a successful negotiation of a PTP TSPEC or a TSPEC in a DMG BSS, the frames corresponding
 to the PTP TSPEC or TSPEC are identified within the DMG STA by the combination of TSID, requesting
 non-AP DMG STA address, and responding non-AP DMG STA address and direction.
 It is always the responsibility of the non-AP STA to initiate the creation of a TS regardless of its direction. A
 STA that is not a DMG STA shall not transmit a PTP TSPEC or a DMG TSPEC. A non-AP DMG STA that
 is not the source DMG STA of a specific TS shall not initiate the exchange of a TSPEC to the AP DMG
 STA or PCP DMG STA to create that TS. Any non-AP DMG STA can issue a PTP TSPEC to any other
 non-AP DMG STA to create a TS.
 In the direct-link or TDLS direct-link case, it is the responsibility of the STA that is going to send the data to
 create the TS. In this case, the STA negotiates with the HC to gain TXOPs that it uses to send the data. There
 is no negotiation between the originator and recipient STAs concerning the TS: the originator can discover
 the capabilities of the recipient (rates, BlockAck) using the DLS.
 In the case of traffic relayed by an PCP/AP, the sending and receiving non-PCP/non-AP STAs may both
 create individual TSs for the traffic. In an infrastructure BSS, aAny traffic classifier created for the downlink
 TS applies equally regardless of whether the source is in the same BSS or reached through the DS.
 In a non-DMG infrastructure BSS, aA non-AP STA may simultaneously support up to eight TSs from the
 HC to itself and up to eight TSs from itself to other STAs, including the HC. The actual number it supports
 may be less due to implementation restrictions.
 In a non-DMG infrastructure BSS, aAn HC may simultaneously support up to eight downlink TSs and up to
 eight uplink TSs per associated STA. The actual number it supports may be less due to implementation
 restrictions.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                   Std 802.11ad-2012
Within a DMG BSS there may be up to 16 TSs from a source DMG STA to a destination DMG STA. An
additional 16 TSs may be created between the two DMG STAs by reversing the roles of source and
destination. The actual number supported in any direction may be less due to implementation restrictions in
either the source or destination DMG STA.
In a non-DMG BSS, tThe traffic admitted in context of a TSPEC can be sent using EDCA, HCCA, or
HEMM. This depends on the access policy set in the TS Info field in the TSPEC. A TSPEC request may be
set so that both HCCA and EDCA mechanisms (i.e., HEMM) are used.
In a DMG BSS, the traffic admitted in the context of a PTP TSPEC or TSPEC is sent according to the access
policy set in the TS Info field of the PTP TSPEC or TSPEC, respectively. Specifically, the traffic is sent
during one or more CBAP allocations if the access policy is EDCA, during an SP allocation if the access
policy is SPCA, and during one SP allocation as well as zero or more CBAP allocations if the access policy
is SEMM.
A DMG STA transmitting a DMG TSPEC shall set the LP SC Used subfield within the DMG TSPEC to 1 to
indicate that the low-power SC PHY described in 21.7 is used during the allocation. All frames sent during
such an allocation shall use the low-power SC PHY. The DMG STA shall set the LP SC Used subfield to 1
only if the DMG STA identified in the Destination AID field within the DMG TSPEC supports the low-
power SC PHY (8.4.2.130.2). In all other cases, the LP SC Used subfield shall be set to 0.
When dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated is true, TSPEC processing by the HC may be subject to limitations
received from the SSPN interface. The SSPN may limit access to certain QoS priorities, and further restrict
the data rate and delay used with any priority.
10.4.2 TSPEC Construction
Change the first paragraph in 10.4.2 as follows:
DMG TSPECs and TSPECs are constructed at the SME, from application requirements supplied via the
SME, and with information specific to the MAC layer. Except as described in this subclause, there are no
normative requirements on how any TSPEC is to be generated. However, N.3.2 describes parameter choice
for the TSPEC. There are no normative requirements on how any DMG TSPEC is to be generated.
10.4.3 TS life cycle
Insert the following paragraph after the third paragraph (“A TS may be established ....”) of 10.4.3:
Unless stated otherwise, in a DMG BSS, the owner of an SP is the source DMG STA for that SP, and the
owner of a TXOP is the TXOP holder. A STA that owns an SP or a TXOP is said to have the ownership of
the SP or the TXOP, respectively. The rules applicable to an SP or TXOP owner are defined in 9.33 and
10.4.
Change the now sixth, seventh, and eighth paragraphs of 10.4.3 as follows:
While the TS is active, the parameters of the TSPEC characterizing the TS or the parameters of the DMG
TSPEC characterizing the allocation carrying the TS can be renegotiated, when the renegotiation is initiated
by the non-AP STA. This negotiation might succeed, resulting in a change to the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC,
or might fail, resulting in no change to the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC.
An active TS becomes inactive following a TS deletion process initiated at either non-AP STA or HC. It also
becomes inactive following a TS timeout detected at the HC, or if the HC within an AP when
dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated is true determines as defined in 10.24.5 that the non-AP STA’s TS has
exceeded the transmitted MSDU limit for the access category in which the TS was admitted. In a DMG BSS,

 a TS timeout is detected at a non-AP STA and causes the TS deletion process to be initiated at the non-AP
 STA. When an active TS becomes inactive, all the resources allocated for the TS are released.
 An active TS may become suspended if no activity is detected for a duration of a suspension interval. Upon
 detection of activity, the TS may be reinstated. While the TS is in the suspended state, the HC shall not
 reclaim the resources assigned to the TS. In a DMG BSS, a TS in which both the source and destination are
 non-PCP/non-AP STAs shall not be suspended.
 10.4.4 TS Setup
 10.4.4.2 Non-Ap-STA-initiated TS setup
 In Figure 10-8, replace “HC” by “HC/non-AP STA” (in two places).
 10.4.4.4 TS setup procedures for both AP and non-AP STA initiation
 Change 10.4.4.4 as follows:
 The non-AP STA’s SME decides that a TS needs to be created. How it does this, as well as how it selects the
 TSPEC or DMG TSPEC parameters, is beyond the scope of this standard. The SME generates an MLME-
 ADDTS.request primitive containing a TSPEC or DMG TSPEC. A TSPEC or DMG TSPEC may also be
 generated autonomously by the MAC without any initiation by the SME. However, if a TSPEC or DMG
 TSPEC is generated subsequently by the SME and the responding MLME-ADDTS.confirm primitive
 contains ResultCode=SUCCESS, the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC containing the same TSID generated
 autonomously by the MAC shall be overridden. If one or more TSPECs or DMG TSPECs are initiated by
 the SME, the autonomous TSPEC or DMG TSPEC shall be terminated.
 The STA’s MLME transmits the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC in an ADDTS Request frame to the HC/non-AP
 STA and starts a response timer called ADDTS timer of duration dot11ADDTSResponseTimeout. If the
 non-AP STA’s MLME is in power save mode, the STA shall include its Wakeup Schedule element in the
 ADDTS Request frame variant and in the DMG ADDTS Request frame variant.
 The HC/non-AP’s MLME receives this management frame and generates an MLME-ADDTS.indication
 primitive to its SME containing the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC.
 The SME in the HC/non-AP STA decides whether to admit the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC with its associated
 TCLAS element(s) (if present) and TCLAS processing element (if present), as specified, refuse the TSPEC
 or DMG TSPEC, or not admit but suggest an alternative TSPEC or TCLAS element(s) or TCLAS
 processing element or DMG TSPEC.
 If the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC is received from a non-AP STA by an AP when
 dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated is true, the HC shall use the permissions stored in dot11InterworkingEntry for
 that STA in the decision to admit or deny the request (see 10.24.5.3). The SME then generates an
 MLME-ADDTS.response primitive containing the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC, zero or more TCLAS
 element(s) (only if present in the request) and TCLAS processing element (only if present in the request),
 and a ResultCode value. The contents of the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC field, TCLAS element(s) (if present),
 TCLAS processing element (if present), and ResultCode field contain values specified in 6.3.26.5.2. The
 SME may include fewer TCLAS elements in the MLME-ADDTS.response primitive than were present in
 the request; when the SME’s response includes a single TCLAS element, it shall not include a TCLAS
 processing element. If the SME changes a TCLAS element’s Classifier Type field in the MLME-
 ADDTS.response primitive but is unable to suggest a value for the Classifier Mask field, it shall set that field
 to 0. If the SME changes a TCLAS element’s Classifier Type field or Classifier Mask field in the MLME-
 ADDTS.response primitive but is unable to suggest values for one or more Classifier Parameter subfields, it
 shall set those subfields to 0.

When the HC in an AP that has dot11SSPNInterfaceActivated equal to true receives a TSPEC, the AP shall
inspect it to determine the requested access policy, user priority, and mean data rate as follows:
   a)    The access category shall be determined from the user priority according to Table 9-1. For a TS to
         be admitted when the requested access policy is EDCA, both of the following shall be true:
         1)    The field corresponding to this access category in dot11NonAPStationAuthAccessCategories
               from the non-AP STA’s dot11InterworkingEntry is equal to 1.
         2)    The sum of the mean data rate of all the requesting STA’s active TSs in this access category
               plus the mean data rate in the TSPEC is less than or equal to the non-AP STA’s
               dot11InterworkingEntry               for               dot11NonAPStationAuthMaxVoiceRate,
               dot11NonAPStationAuthMaxVideoRate, dot11NonAPStationAuthMaxBestEffortRate, or
               dot11NonAPStationAuthMaxBackgroundRate depending on whether the derived access
               category is AC_VO, AC_VI, AC_BE or AC_BK, respectively.
   b)    For a TS to be admitted when the requested access policy is HCCA, all of the following shall be
         true:
         1)    The dot11NonAPStationAuthHCCAHEMM value is true.
         2)    The sum of the mean data rate of all the requesting STA’s active TSs having access policy set
               to HCCA plus the mean data rate in the TSPEC is less than or equal to
               dot11NonAPStationAuthMaxHCCAHEMMRate                     in     the        non-AP         STA’s
               dot11InterworkingEntry.
         3)    The delay bound that will be provided by the HC in the TSPEC response is less than or equal to
               dot11NonAPStationAuthHCCAHEMMDelay in the non-AP STA’s dot11InterworkingEntry.
If the DMG TSPEC is admitted, the PCP/AP shall set the ResultCode to
SUCCESS_STA_IN_DOZE_MODE if the STA identified by destination AID is in power save mode and
shall include in the ADDTS Response frame the Wakeup Schedule element of the destination DMG STA if
one is established. In this case, the PCP/AP should defer including the TS schedule in the Extended
Schedule element until both source DMG STA and destination DMG STA are in active mode.
The HC/non-AP’s MLME transmits an ADDTS Response frame containing this TSPEC or DMG TSPEC
and status. The encoding of the ResultCode values to Status Code field values is defined in Table 8-37. The
PCP/AP shall transmit the ADDTS Response frame to the STAs identified as source and destination AID of
the DMG TSPEC contained in the ADDTS Request frame if the ADDTS Request it is sent by a non-PCP/
non-AP STA. If the ResultCode is SUCCESS, the PCP/AP shall announce the creation of the allocation by
setting the Allocation ID field in the TSPEC element sent in the ADDTS Response frame to a nonzero value
and also by including the allocation schedule in the Extended Schedule element transmitted in the DMG
Beacon frame or Announce frame.
The STA’s MLME receives this management frame and cancels its ADDTS timer. It generates an MLME-
ADDTS.confirm primitive to its SME containing the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC and status.
The SME decides whether the response meets its needs. How it does this is beyond the scope of this
standard. A SME receiving a modified TCLAS element having a Classifier Mask field equal to 0 or
Classifier Parameter subfields equal to 0 should regard these values as meaning that no suggested value has
been provided by the HC.
   —     If the result code is SUCCESS, the TS enters into an active state.
   —     If the result code is REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_BSS_TRANSITION, the non-AP STA may
         try to transition to other BSSs. In the case that the non-AP STA is recommended to transition to
         other BSSs, it should do so according to the process defined in 10.23.6. Once the transition is
         completed, it should proceed with a TS setup process with the new HC.
   —     Otherwise, the whole process can be repeated using the same TSID and direction, a modified
         TSPEC or DMG TSPEC, optional TCLAS element(s), and an optional TCLAS processing element

          until the SME decides that the granted medium time is adequate or inadequate and cannot be
          improved.
 The above rules also apply to the negotiation of the PTP TSPEC and to the negotiation of the DMG TSPEC.
 The parameters that are set for a TS may be renegotiated in a similar manner, when such a request is
 generated by the SME through ADDTS.request primitive. When a request for the modification of the TS
 parameters is accepted by the HC, it shall reset both the suspension interval and the inactivity interval
 timers.
 When a request for the modification of the TS parameters is accepted by a non-AP STA, it shall reset the
 inactivity interval timers.
 If the HC/PCP grants medium time for an ADDTS Request frame with the Ack Policy subfield equal to
 Block Ack and the Direction field equal to either downlink or bidirectional, then it shall initiate a Block Ack
 negotiation by sending an ADDBA Request frame to the STA that originated the ADDTS Request frame. If
 a non-DMG STA is granted medium time for an ADDTS Request frame with the Ack Policy subfield equal
 to Block Ack and the Direction field equal to other than downlink, then it shall initiate a Block Ack
 negotiation by sending an ADDBA Request frame to the recipient of the TS.
 In a non-DMG BSS, tThe combination of the TSID and Direction subfields identifies the TS, in the context
 of the STA, to which the TSPEC applies. A bidirectional link request is equivalent to a downlink TS and an
 uplink TS, each with the same TSID and parameters. In a DMG BSS, the combination of the TSID, source
 DMG STA AID, destination DMG STA AID, and Direction subfields identifies the TS, in the context of the
 non-AP STA, to which the TSPEC applies.
 The same TSID may be used for multiple TSs at different STAs. A STA can use the same TSID subfield
 value for a downlink TSPEC and either an uplink or a direct-link TSPEC at the same time. In a non-DMG
 BSS, aA non-AP STA shall not use the same TSID for both uplink and direct-link TS. In a DMG BSS, a
 non-AP STA as a source DMG STA can use the TSID subfield value for an uplink PTP TSPEC, and at the
 same time the non-AP STA as a destination DMG STA can use the same TSID subfield value for a downlink
 PTP TSPEC.
 If the TS Info Ack Policy subfield of a TSPEC element is Block Ack and the type of Block Ack policy is
 unknown to the HC, the HC assumes, for TXOP scheduling, that the immediate Block Ack policy is being
 used (see 9.21).
 An HC shall be capable of receiving an ADDTS request frame that contains a TCLAS element and capable
 of generating an indication that contains this as a parameter.
 When a STA requests service at a higher priority than authorized by its dot11InterworkingTableEntry, the
 HC may optionally provide a suggested TSPEC with a data rate and lower priority that would be authorized.
 Usage of the TSPEC in an Interworking environment is described in Annex N.
 A STA may include a U-PID element in ADDTS Request and ADDTS Response frames transmitted by the
 STA. The U-PID element is used to indicate the protocol responsible for handling MSDUs corresponding to
 the TID indicated within the frame carrying the U-PID element. If a U-PID element is not included in an
 ADDTS Request frame, MSDUs corresponding to the TID contain an LLC protocol header that is used for
 upper layer protocol selection. A U-PID element shall not be included in an ADDTS Response frame if a U-
 PID element was not included in the corresponding ADDTS Request frame. If a U-PID element was
 included in an ADDTS Request frame, the value of the LLC header copy field within a U-PID element
 included in the ADDTS Response frame that has a Status Code of success and is transmitted in response to
 the received ADDTS Request frame shall be the same as the LLC header copy field contained in the
 ADDTS Request frame. The STA shall set the Status Code field to REJECT_U-PID_SETTING in the
 368                                                                   Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

ADDTS Response frame if it rejects the ADDTS Request frame due to the setting of the U-PID element
received within the ADDTS Request frame.
All MSDUs corresponding to a TID that was successfully negotiated through the ADDTS exchange with a
U-PID element shall have their LLC header stripped before transmission and the agreed LLC header added
before delivery at the peer MAC-SAP.
10.4.7 Failed TS Setup
Change 10.4.7 as follows:
There are two possible types of failed TS setup:
   a)    The transmission of ADDTS Request frame failed.
   b)   No ADDTS Response frame is received from the HC/non-AP STA (e.g., because of delay due to
         congestion or because the response frame cannot be transmitted).
Figure 10-9 summarizes the remaining two cases. The MLME shall issue an MLME-ADDTS.confirm
primitive, with a result code of TIMEOUT. In either case and for a non-DMG BSS, if the request is not for
an existing TS, the MLME shall send a DELTS to the HC specifying the TSID and direction of the failed
request just in case the HC had received the request and it was the response that was lost. In both cases and
for a DMG BSS, if the request is not for an existing allocation or TS, the MLME shall send a DELTS to the
non-AP STA specifying the Allocation ID or TSID and destination DMG STA of the failed request just in
case the PCP/AP had received the request and it was the response that was lost.
In Figure 10-9, replace “HC” by “HC or non-AP STA” (in four places).
10.4.8 Data Transfer
Change the first paragraph in 10.4.8 as indicated below:
After the setup of a TSPEC or PTP TSPEC, MSDUs are classified above the MAC and are sent to the MAC
through the MAC_SAP using the MA-UNITDATA.request primitive with the priority parameter encoded to
the TSID.
Insert the following paragraphs after the first paragraph of 10.4.8:
In a DMG BSS, MSDUs are transmitted using QoS data frames. During each CBAP allocation, the MAC
delivers MSDUs based on the priority of the transmitted QoS data frames. The MAC can transmit all
MSDUs having a TSID with an associated TSPEC with an access policy of EDCA or SEMM, provided that
the source AID of the CBAP allocation is equal to the source AID of the TS, or the source AID of the CBAP
allocation is equal to broadcast AID, or the destination AID of the CBAP matches the destination AID of
the TS.
NOTE—MSDUs having a TSID with no associated TSPEC are not transmitted.
During each SP allocation, the MAC delivers MSDUs whose TSIDs identify TSPECs that have been set up
to use the SP allocation. Relative prioritization of multiple TSPECs mapped to the same SP allocation is
implementation dependent and outside the scope of this standard.
When an MSDU arrives from the MAC_SAP with a TSID for which there is no associated TSPEC, the
MSDUs shall be sent using EDCA with the access category AC_BE.

 10.4.9 TS Deletion
 Change 10.4.9 as indicated below:
 There are two types of TS deletion: non-PCP/non-AP STA-initiated and HC/PCP-initiated. In both cases,
 the SME entity above the MAC generates an MLME-DELTS.request primitive specifying either the TS or
 the allocation TSID and direction of the TS to be deleted and the reason for deleting the TS or allocation,
 respectively. This causes the MAC to send a DELTS Action frame.
 In a PBSS and DMG infrastructure BSS, an SP or CBAP allocation can be deleted at any point in time. A
 PCP/AP can delete any allocation. A non-PCP/non-AP STA can delete only allocations for which either the
 Source AID or Destination AID of the allocation is equal to the STA’s AID. Deleting an allocation also
 deletes any TS that is dependent on that allocation as follows:
    —     Deleting an SP allocation shall also delete any TS with access policy SPCA or SEMM using the
          allocation.
    —     Deleting a CBAP allocation with Source AID different from the broadcast AID shall also delete any
          TS with access policy EDCA using the allocation.
    —     Deleting a CBAP allocation with Source AID equal to the broadcast AID shall also delete any TS
          with access policy EDCA using the allocation, unless there is another CBAP allocation the TS could
          use.
 A DMG STA that receives an MLME-DELTS.request primitive for an allocation causes the MAC to send a
 DELTS Action frame to the PCP/AP. If the Destination AID of the allocation is different from the broadcast
 AID, the PCP/AP shall send a DELTS Action frame to the STA identified by the Destination AID of the
 allocation. The PCP/AP shall also delete the scheduling information corresponding to the allocation and
 contained in the Extended Schedule element.
 A DMG STA that receives an MLME-DELTS.request primitive for a TS causes the MAC to send a DELTS
 Action frame to the peer STA of the TS.
 The encoding of ReasonCode values to Reason Code field (see 8.4.1.7) values is defined in Table 8-36.
 The TS or allocation is considered inactive within the initiating MAC when the ACK frame to the Action
 frame is received. No Action frame response is generated.
 Figure 10-10 shows the case of TS deletion initiated by the non-PCP/non-AP STA and the case of TS
 deletion initiated by the HC/PCP.
 In Figure 10-10, replace “HC” by “HC or non-AP STA” (in five places).
 An HC should not delete a TSPEC without a request from the SME except due to inactivity (see 10.4.10) or
 an HC service change that precludes the HC from continuing to meet the requirements of the TSPEC.
 All TSPECs or DMG TSPECs that have been set up shall be deleted upon disassociation and reassociation.
 Reassociation causes the non-PCP/non-AP STA and PCP/AP to clear their state, and the non-PCP/non-AP
 STA has to reinitiate the setup.
 10.4.10 TS Timeout
 Change 10.4.10 as indicated below:
 TS timeout is detected within the HC/non-AP STA’s MAC when no traffic is detected on the TS within the
 inactivity timeout specified when the TS was created.
 370                                                                    Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

For an uplink TS in a non-DMG BSS or for a TS that has the PCP/AP as the destination DMG STA in a
DMG BSS, the timeout is based on the arrival of correctly received MSDUs that belong to the TS after any
decryption and reassembly.
For a downlink TS in a non-DMG BSS or for a TS that has the PCP/AP as the source DMG STA in a DMG
BSS, the timeout is based on the following:
   —     Arrival of valid MA-UNITDATA.request primitives using this TS at the MAC_SAP when the QoS
         data frames are sent with the Ack Policy subfield set to No Ack.
   —     Confirmation of correctly sent MSDUs that belong to the TS within the MAC when the QoS data
         frames are sent with the Ack Policy subfield set other than to No Ack.
In a DMG BSS and in the case of a TS that is established between non-AP STAs (PTP TSPEC), the timeout
of the recipient is based on the arrival of correctly received MSDUs that belong to the TS within the MAC
after any decryption, A-MSDU unpacking, and reassembly.
For a TS established between non-AP STAs (PTP TSPEC), the timeout of the originator is based on the
following:
   —     Arrival of valid MA-UNITDATA.request primitives using this TS at the MAC_SAP when the QoS
         data frames are sent with the Ack Policy subfield set to No Ack.
   —     Confirmation of correctly sent MSDUs that belong to the TS within the MAC when the QoS data
         frames are sent with the Ack Policy subfield set other than to No Ack.
For a direct-link TS in a non-DMG BSS, inactivity is considered to have happened if one of the two
following events occurs:
   —     The HC transmits a QoS CF-Poll frame and the polled STA returns a QoS Null immediately after a
         SIFS interval that contains a QoS Control field in which the Queue Size subfield contains 0.
   —     The HC transmits a QoS CF-Poll frame, and no QoS Null frame is received within the granted
         TXOP duration that indicates the queue size for related TSID. This is to ensure that the STA is
         actually using the assigned TXOP for the given TSID.
In a non-DMG BSS, Aany other use of a polled TXOP delivered to the STA is considered to be activity on
all direct-link TSs associated with that STA. Detection of inactivity of this type is optional.
In response to an inactivity timeout, the HC shall send a DELTS frame to the STA with the result code set to
TIMEOUT and inform its SME using the MLME-DELTS.indication primitive. In response to an inactivity
timeout, the AP DMG STA shall send a DELTS frame to the non-AP DMG STA with the result code set to
TIMEOUT and inform its SME using the MLME-DELTS.indication primitive. In response to an inactivity
timeout, the PCP DMG STA shall send a DELTS frame to the non-PCP DMG STA with the result code set
to TIMEOUT and inform its SME using the MLME-DELTS.indication primitive.
In a DMG BSS when a TS is established between non-AP STAs (PTP TSPEC), then in response to a TS
timeout detected within the originator non-AP STA the non-AP STA shall send a DELTS frame to the
recipient non-AP STA with the result code set to TIMEOUT and inform its SME using the MLME-
DELTS.indication primitive. If the TS timeout is detected within the recipient non-AP STA, the STA shall
send a DELTS frame to the originator non-AP STA with the result code set to TIMEOUT and inform its
SME using the MLME-DELTS.indication primitive.
The case of uplink TS timeout in which the PCP/AP is the destination DMG STA of the TS is shown in
Figure 10-11.

 In Figure 10-11, replace “HC” by “HC or non-AP STA” (in four places).
 Insert the following subclauses, 10.4.13 to 10.4.14, after 10.4.12:
 10.4.13 DMG allocation formats
 10.4.13.1 General
 A DMG STA manages allocations and TSs as described in 10.4.1 to 10.4.14. Using the DMG TSPEC, a
 DMG STA can indicate two types of allocation scheduling: isochronous and asynchronous. It should
 establish an isochronous allocation if it needs periodic access to the channel and does not expect to change
 the amount of time allocated frequently. It should establish an asynchronous allocation if it expects to make
 requests for channel time and wishes to reserve a minimum amount of channel time to satisfy for those
 requests when they occur.
 10.4.13.2 Isochronous allocations
 In order to request the setup of an isochronous allocation, a DMG STA shall set the Allocation Format field
 in the DMG TSPEC element to 1.
 Following the successful admittance of a DMG TSPEC with an isochronous allocation, the PCP/AP should
 allocate time in the beacon interval to meet the periodicity and minimum allocation requirements specified
 in the DMG TSPEC element.
 Referring to fields in the DMG TSPEC element, the PCP/AP should check that over each Allocation Period
 the sum of the time allocations is at least the Minimum Allocation. In addition, the PCP/AP should check
 that each individual allocation has a minimum duration of at least Minimum SP Duration. See 8.4.2.136,
 9.33.6, and 9.33.6.4.
 With an isochronous DMG TSPEC, the allocation period defines the period over which the channel time
 allocation repeats. The scheduler should check that at least the minimum allocation is made within each
 allocation period. The allocation may be composed of multiple SPs. The scheduler also checks that each SP
 making up the allocation is no shorter than the minimum SP duration. The scheduler is free to position the
 SPs that make up the allocation anywhere in the allocation period. The scheduler may allocate up to the
 maximum allocation each allocation period if resources permit.
 10.4.13.3 Asynchronous allocations
 A DMG STA uses the SPR frame to request channel time for asynchronous traffic.
 For each TID, source DMG STA, and destination DMG STA tuple, the PCP/AP can maintain the amount of
 outstanding channel time that needs to be allocated. Each time it receives an SPR frame, the amount of
 outstanding channel time is set to the value received in the SPR frame from the source DMG STA for the
 identified TID and destination DMG STA. The amount of outstanding channel time is decreased by the
 amount allocated when channel time is schedule for that TID, source DMG STA, and destination DMG STA
 tuple.
 A DMG STA may also use a DMG TSPEC to reserve resources for asynchronous traffic. In this case, the
 STA shall set the Allocation Format field in the DMG TSPEC element to 0. The PCP/AP should admit an
 asynchronous DMG TSPEC only if it is able to meet the minimum allocation requirements specified in the
 DMG TSPEC element.
 With an asynchronous DMG TSPEC, the DMG STA registers the minimum allocation it expects within the
 allocation period while an SP request is in effect that is greater than the minimum allocation specified. In
 372                                                                    Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.
                                                                                                           IEEE

addition, the STA expects that each allocation is at least Minimum Duration microseconds in duration
provided the outstanding SP request is at least that much. In admitting a DMG TSPEC, the PCP/AP should
check that there are sufficient resources available to meet the TSPEC requirements.
10.4.14 PTP TS Operation
The ADDTS Request frame containing the PTP TSPEC may be sent to the peer non-AP DMG STA directly
or through PCP/AP DMG STA.
A non-AP DMG STA may add TSs to an existing allocation. To do this, the non-AP DMG STA transmits an
ADDTS Request frame to peer non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA to include the additional TS. The ADDTS
Request frame shall contain a PTP TSPEC with the Allocation ID field set to indicate the desired allocation
to carry the additional TS. A TS with EDCA access policy does not need to be added to any CBAP
allocation and can use any CBAP allocation as long as the source AID of the CBAP allocation matches the
source AID of the TS, or the source AID of the CBAP allocation is equal to the broadcast AID, or the
destination AID of the CBAP matches the destination AID of the TS.
A non-AP DMG STA transmits an ADDTS Request frame to a peer non-AP DMG STA to add a TS to an
existing allocation and to possibly communicate traffic-specific parameters such as A-MSDU subframe and
Maximum MSDU Size with the peer non-AP DMG STA. The non-AP DMG STA may transmit the ADDTS
Request frame directly to the peer DMG STA or to the PCP/AP. In the latter case, the ADDTS Request
frame shall contain a TCLAS element with the classifier type set to Ethernet parameters; the Source Address
field shall contain the address of the DMG STA that sends the ADDTS Request frame; and the Destination
Address field shall contain the address of the peer DMG STA, which is used by PCP/AP to forward to the
peer DMG STA.
The AP DMG STA or PCP DMG STA shall forward the received ADDTS Request frame to the DMG STA
with Address equal to the Destination Address field of the Classifier. If an ADDTS Response frame is
received by the AP DMG STA or PCP DMG STA in response to the forwarded ADDTS Request frame,
then the AP DMG STA or PCP DMG STA shall forward the ADDTS Response frame to the DMG STA
with Address equal to the Source Address field of the Classifier. The AP DMG STA and the PCP DMG
STA shall not change the content of the elements included in the ADDTS Request and ADDTS Response
frames.
If the DMG STA asserts the direction field to a value equal to Downlink in the PTP TSPEC included in the
ADDTS Request frame, the parameters apply to the DMG STA as the receiving station. For example, in this
case, the Maximum MSDU Size field indicates that the DMG STA is not able to receive MSDUs longer than
the value presented in the MSDU Size field. Similarly, if the direction field indicates uplink, the DMG STA
that issued the ADDTS Request frame does not send MSDUs longer than the value of the Maximum MSDU
Size field.

          present, the originator sends an ADDBA Request frame that includes a GCR Group Address
          element. All DMG STAs are capable of participating in the Block Ack mechanism.
 10.5.2.4 Procedure common to both originator and recipient
 Change the text in 10.5.2.4 as follows:
 Once a Block Ack agreement has been successfully established between two STAs, the type of agreement
 thus established is dependent on the capabilities of the STAs and the contents of the ADDBA frames used to
 establish this agreement as defined in Table 10-2 for non-DMG STAs and in Table 10-2a for DMG STAs.
 Table 10-2 remains unchanged.
 Insert the following table, Table 10-2a, and note at the end of 10.5.2.4:

Change the first bullet in the third paragraph of 10.8.1 as follows:
   —     Association of STAs with an PCP/AP in a BSS based on the STAs’ power capability (see 10.8.2).
Change the first sentence in the fourth paragraph of 10.8.1 as follows:
If dot11SpectrumManagementRequired is true, a non-DMG STA shall not join an infrastructure BSS,
MBSS, or IBSS unless the Spectrum Management bit is 1 in the Capability Information field in Beacon
frames and Probe Response frames or in the Condensed Capability Information field in Measurement Pilot
frames received from other STAs in the BSS, with the following exceptions:
10.8.2 Association based on transmit power capability
Change 10.8.2 as follows:
A STA shall provide an PCP/AP with its minimum and maximum transmit power capability for the current
channel when associating or reassociating, using a Power Capability element in Association Request frames
or Reassociation Request frames.
An PCP/AP may use the minimum and maximum transmit power capability of associated STAs as an input
into the algorithm used to determine the local transmit power constraint for any BSS it maintains. The
specification of the algorithm is beyond the scope of this standard.
An PCP/AP may reject an association or reassociation request from a STA if it considers the STA’s
minimum or maximum transmit power capability to be unacceptable. For example, a STA’s power
capability might be unacceptable if it violates local regulatory constraints or increases the probability of
hidden STAs by a significant degree. The criteria for accepting or rejecting an association or reassociation
on the basis of transmit power capability are beyond the scope of this standard.
10.8.4 Specification of regulatory and local maximum transmit power levels
Change the first and second paragraphs of 10.8.4 as follows:
A STA shall determine a regulatory maximum transmit power for the current channel. The STA shall use the
minimum of the following:
   —     Any regulatory maximum transmit power received in a Country element from the AP in its BSS,
         PCP in its PBSS, another STA in its IBSS, or a neighbor peer mesh STA in its MBSS and
   —     Any regulatory maximum transmit power for the channel in the current regulatory domain known by
         the STA from other sources.
A STA shall determine a local maximum transmit power for the current channel by selecting the minimum
of the following:
   —     Any local maximum transmit power received in the combination of a Country element and a Power
         Constraint element from the AP in its BSS, PCP in its PBSS, another STA in its IBSS, or a neighbor
         peer mesh STA in its MBSS and
   —     Any local maximum transmit power for the channel regulatory domain known by the STA from
         other sources.

 Insert a new paragraph before the last paragraph of 10.8.4 as follows:
 In a PBSS, the PCP should advertise the regulatory maximum transmit power for its operating channel in
 DMG Beacon frames and shall advertise it in Announce and Probe Response frames using a Country
 element. A PCP in a PBSS should advertise the local maximum transmit power for its operating channel in
 DMG Beacon frames and shall advertise it in Announce and Probe Response frames using the combination
 of a Country element and a Power Constraint element.
 Change the last paragraph of 10.8.4 as follows:
 Where TPC is being used for radio measurement without spectrum management, the inclusion of a Power
 Constraint element in Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, and Probe Response frames shall be optional.
 10.8.6 Adaptation of the transmit power
 Change the second and third paragraphs of 10.8.6 as follows:
 A STA may use a TPC Request frame to request another STA to respond with a TPC Report frame
 containing link margin and transmit power information. A STA receiving a TPC Request frame shall
 respond with a TPC Report frame containing the power used to transmit the response in the Transmit Power
 field and the estimated link margin in a Link Margin field. A DMG STA may also use the Link
 Measurement procedure and the DMG Link Margin element to perform TPC.
 An AP in a BSS, PCP in a PBSS, or a STA in an IBSS shall autonomously include a TPC Report element
 with the Link Margin field set to 0 and containing transmit power information in the Transmit Power field in
 any Beacon frame, DMG Beacon frame, Announce frame, or Probe Response frame it transmits.
 10.9 DFS procedures
 10.9.1 General
 Change the second paragraph of 10.9.1 as follows:
 This subclause describes DFS procedures that can be used to satisfy these and similar future regulatory
 requirements. The procedures might also satisfy comparable needs in other frequency bands and may be
 useful for other purposes. For example, some of the procedures described in this subclause may be used for
 channel selection in a DMG BSS.
 Insert the following paragraph after the third paragraph (“STAs shall use ....”) of 10.9.1:
 In a DMG BSS, the following DFS procedures apply:
    —    Associating a STA with an AP or a PCP based on the STA’s supported channels (see 10.9.2).
    —    Quieting the current channel so it can be tested for interference with less interference from
         associated STAs (see 10.9.3).
    —    Requesting and reporting measurements in the current and other channels (see 10.9.7).
    —    Selecting and advertising a new channel to assist the migration of an infrastructure BSS, IBSS, or
         PBSS (see 10.9.8).

10.9.2 Association based on supported channels
Insert the following subclause title immediately after the title of 10.9.2:
10.9.2.1 Association based on supported channels in a non-DMG BSS
The text formerly in 10.9.2 (“A STA shall provide ... scope of this standard.”) is unchanged.
Insert the following subclause, 10.9.2.2, after 10.9.2.1:
10.9.2.2 Providing supported channels upon association in a DMG BSS
A PCP/AP may advertise the regulatory domain in which it is located via a Country element in the DMG
Beacon, Announce, or Information Response frame if dot11MultiDomainCapabilityEnabled is true.
A STA shall provide a PCP/AP with a list of the channels in which it can operate when associating or
reassociating using a Supported Channels element in Information Request, Association Request, or
Reassociation Request frames. A PCP/AP can use the supported channels list for associated STAs as an
input into an algorithm used to select a new channel for the BSS. The specification of the algorithm is
beyond the scope of this standard.
The PCP/AP may advertise the supported channels of associated STAs via an Information Response frame
with Subject Address field set to the broadcast address and a Supported Channels element that lists the
intersection of channels supported by STAs associated with the BSS, as indicated by their Supported
Channels elements.
10.9.3 Quieting channels for testing
Insert the following paragraph at the beginning of 10.9.3:
A PCP/AP in a DMG BSS may measure one or more channels itself, or the PCP/AP may request associated
non-PCP/non-AP STAs in the same BSS to measure one or more channels, either in a dedicated
measurement interval or during normal operation. The PCP/AP in a DMG BSS may schedule a service
period allocated to itself to quiet the associated STAs and use the self-allocated SP for measurement.
10.9.7 Requesting and reporting of measurements
Change the first paragraph of 10.9.7 as follows:
The response to a basic request is a basic report. It is mandatory for a STA in a PBSS or in an infrastructure
BSS to generate a basic report in response to a basic request if the request is received from the PCP/AP with
which it is associated, except as specified in this subclause.

 Change the 13th paragraph of 10.9.7 as follows:
 A STA may enable or disable measurement requests or autonomous measurement reports from another STA
 by transmitting Measurement Request elements with the Enable bit set to 1 and the Request bit and Report
 bit set to 0 or 1, as appropriate. These elements do not require a corresponding Measurement Report element
 in a Measurement Report frame. All measurement requests and reports are enabled by default. An PCP/AP
 may ignore a request to disable a mandatory measurement request. All others requests shall be honored.
 Insert the following paragraph at the end of 10.9.7:
 The measurement request and report procedures are defined in 10.11.
 10.9.8 Selecting and advertising a new channel
 Insert the following subclause, 10.9.8.6, after 10.9.8.5:
 10.9.8.6 Selecting and advertising a new channel in a DMG BSS
 The decision to switch to a new operating channel in a BSS shall be made only by a PCP/AP. A PCP/AP
 may make use of the information in Supported Channel elements and the results of measurements
 undertaken by the PCP/AP and other STAs in the BSS to assist the selection of the new channel. The
 algorithm to choose a new channel is beyond the scope of this standard, but shall satisfy applicable
 regulatory requirements.
 A PCP/AP shall inform associated STAs that the PCP/AP is changing to a new channel and maintain the
 association by advertising the switch using the Extended Channel Switch Announcement element in DMG
 Beacon frames, Announce frames, and Information Response frames until the intended channel switch time.
 The channel switch should be scheduled so that all non-PCP/non-AP STAs in the BSS, including STAs in
 power save mode, have the opportunity to receive at least one Extended Channel Switch Announcement
 element before the switch. A STA may ignore the Channel Switch Mode field and either cease transmissions
 or attempt new transmissions in the operating channel until the channel change takes effect.
 A STA that receives an Extended Channel Switch Announcement element may choose not to perform the
 specified switch, but to take alternative action. For example, it may choose to move to a different BSS. A

Change the fourth paragraph of 10.11.6 as follows:
The source and destination of a measurement request shall both be a member of the same infrastructure BSS,
a member of the same PBSS, or a member of the same IBSS. Measurement requests with an individual
Receiver Address shall be sent only to STAs that have indicated Radio Measurement capability.
10.11.8 Triggered autonomous reporting
Change the ninth paragraph of 10.11.8 as follows:
A STA in an infrastructure BSS or PBSS shall cease all triggered autonomous reporting if it disassociates or
reassociates to a different BSS (reassociation to the same BSS shall not affect triggered reporting). A STA in
an independent BSS shall cease all triggered autonomous reporting if it leaves the BSS.

 Change the third paragraph of 10.11.14 as follows:
 A Multiple BSSID element, with or without optional subelements, indicates that all PCPs/APs within the
 indicated range of BSSIDs transmit using a common class, channel, and antenna connector.
 10.11.16 Access Delay Measurement
 Change 10.11.6 as follows:
 Access delay is measured by the PCP/AP’s MAC layer being the average medium access delay for
 transmitted frames measured from the time the MPDU is ready for transmission (i.e., begins CSMA/CA
 access or SP access, as appropriate) until the actual frame transmission start time. Access delay
 measurement results are included in the BSS Average Delay element and in the BSS AC Access Delay
 element.
 For the BSS Average Delay measurement, the PCP/AP shall measure and average the medium access delay
 for all transmit frames using the DCF or EDCAF over a continuous 30 s measurement window. For the
 infrastructure BSS AC Access Delay measurement, the PCP or QoS AP shall measure and average the
 medium access delay for all transmit frames of the indicated AC (see Figure 8-227) using EDCA mechanism
 over a continuous 30 s measurement window. The accuracy for the average medium access delay shall be
 ± 100 μs or better when averaged over at least 200 frames. Accuracy is not defined for measurements
 averaged over less than 200 frames.
 10.22 Tunneled direct-link setup
 10.22.1 General
 Insert the following paragraph after the third paragraph (“To set up and maintain ....”) of 10.22.1:
 Since the channel access in a DMG BSS allows DMG STAs to send frames directly to each other, DMG
 STAs shall not use the TDLS protocol.
 10.23 Wireless network management procedures
 10.23.14 Channel usage procedures
 Change the second paragraph of 10.23.14 as follows:
 Implementation of Channel Usage is optional for a WNM STA. A STA that implements Channel Usage has
 dot11MgmtOptionChannelUsageImplemented set to true. When dot11MgmtOptionChannel-
 UsageImplemented is true, dot11WirelessManagementImplemented shall be true, or the STA shall be
 capable of acting as an S-AP within a CCSS. A STA that has a value of true for
 dot11MgmtOptionChannelUsageActivated is defined as a STA that supports Channel Usage. A STA for
 which dot11MgmtOptionChannelUsageActivated is true shall set the Channel Usage field of the Extended
 Capabilities element to 1.

10.23.15 Group addressed transmission service
10.23.15.1 General
Change 10.23.15.1 as follows:
The group addressed transmission service provides delivery of group addressed frames and comprises the
two services, DMS and GCR. DMG STAs do not use GCR.
10.23.15.2 DMS procedures
Change the beginning of 10.23.15.2 as follows:
The directed multicast service (DMS) is a service that may be provided by an AP or DMG STA to its
associated non-AP STAs or DMG STAs that support DMS, where the AP or DMG STA transmits group
addressed MSDUs as individually addressed A-MSDUs.
In a PBSS, DMS is a service that may be provided by any STA to other STAs associated in the same PBSS
that support DMS, where the STA transmits group addressed MSDUs as individually addressed A-MSDUs.
If the PCP of the PBSS has the PCP forwarding field within the PCP’s DMG Capabilities element set to 0, a
non-PCP STA in the PBSS cannot employ the PCP to forward frames using DMS to another STA in the
PBSS.
Implementation of DMS is optional for a WNM STA and mandatory for a robust AV streaming STA (as
defined in 10.26.1). A STA that implements DMS has dot11MgmtOptionDMSImplemented set to true.
When dot11MgmtOptionDMSImplemented is true, at least one of dot11WirelessManagementImplemented
and dot11RobustAVStreamingImplemented shall be true, and dot11HighThroughputOptionImplemented
shall be true for a non-DMG STA, and dot11DMGOptionImplemented shall be true for a DMG STA. A
STA that has a value of true for dot11MgmtOptionDMSActivated is defined as a STA that supports Directed
Multicast. A STA for which dot11MgmtOptionDMSActivated is true shall set the DMS field of the
Extended Capabilities element to 1.
In the remaining text in 10.23.15.2, change “AP” to “AP or DMG STA” (in 25 places) and “non-AP
STA” to “non-AP or DMG STA” (in 14 places).
10.23.15.3 GCR procedures
10.23.15.3.1 Overview
Change the second paragraph of 10.23.15.3.1 as follows:
A non-DMG STA with dot11RobustAVStreamingImplemented true shall implement the GCR procedures
defined in 10.23.15.3.2 to 10.23.15.3.6. When dot11RobustAVStreamingImplemented is true,
dot11MgmtOptionDMSImplemented and dot11HighThroughputOptionImplemented shall be true. A non-
DMG STA that implements advanced GCR supports GCR Block Ack (10.23.15.3.7) and GCR-SP
(10.23.15.3.8)      and         has       dot11AdvancedGCRImplemented    set     to     true.     When
dot11AdvancedGCRImplemented is true, dot11RobustAVStreamingImplemented shall be true. In a mesh
BSS, a non-DMG STA that implements GCR has dot11MeshGCRImplemented set to true. When
dot11MeshGCRImplemented is true, dot11HighThroughputOptionImplemented shall be true.

 10.24.3.1 GAS Protocol
 10.24.3.1.2 STA procedures to transmit a GAS Query
 Change item a) of the first paragraph of 10.24.3.1.2 as follows:
    a)   The requesting STA sends a GAS Query by transmitting a GAS Initial Request frame containing a
         Dialog Token, an Advertisement Protocol element containing an Advertisement Protocol ID, and
         the GAS Query in the Query Request field. If the GAS Initial Request frame requests information
         relative to a frequency band different from the frequency band in which the frame is transmitted, the
         STA shall include a Multi-band element in the GAS Initial Request frame with the Band ID,
         Operating Class, and Channel Number fields set to indicate to which frequency band the GAS Initial
         Request frame applies, with other fields within the Multi-band element being reserved. If the frame
         requests information relative to the frequency band in which the frame is transmitted, a Multi-band
         element shall not be included in the frame.
 10.24.3.1.4 STA procedures for transmitting the GAS Query Response
 Insert the following paragraph after the second paragraph (“The GAS protocol supports ....”) of
 10.24.3.1.4:
 If the GAS Initial Request frame that initiated the GAS transaction contains a Multi-band element, but the
 GAS Initial Response frame transmitted as a response does not contain a copy of the same Multi-band
 element, the Status Code in the GAS Initial Response frame shall be set to “The request has been declined.”
 Otherwise, the requesting and responding STAs shall include a copy of the same Multi-band element in all
 subsequent GAS Initial Response, GAS Comeback Request, and GAS Comeback Response frames
 transmitted as part of the GAS transaction. Inclusion of the Multi-band element indicates to which frequency
 band the GAS transaction applies. If the GAS Initial Request frame that initiated the GAS transaction does
 not contain a Multi-band element, then none of the subsequent GAS Initial Response, GAS Comeback
 Request, and GAS Comeback Response frames transmitted as part of the GAS transaction shall include a
 Multi-band element.

 10.28 DMG beamformed link and BSS maintenance
 10.28.1 Beamformed link maintenance
 A pair of DMG STAs that have established a beamformed link can maintain this link. This subclause
 describes procedures that allow a pair of DMG STAs to maintain a beamformed link that was established
 between them.
 A beamformed link is established as a result of the most recent success of the procedures specified in 9.35.2
 if the STAs completed the SLS phase or as a result of the most recent success of the procedures specified in
 9.35.6.4 if the STAs completed the BRP phase.

The DMG STAs shall negotiate the value of dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime or may leave it undefined as
specified in 8.4a.6.
If the dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime has been defined as described in 8.4a.6, the DMG STAs shall
implement a beam link maintenance timer to control each beamformed link. The DMG STA shall keep one
beam link maintenance timer per beamformed link. After it is set, the beam link maintenance timer shall
count down. The timer shall be stopped when it reaches the value zero. The beam link maintenance timer of
a beamformed link shall be halted during the following periods of time:
   —     BTI and A-BFT of a beacon interval
   —     SPs and CBAPs in which the DMG STA does not participate
   —     When any of the DMG STAs involved in the beamformed link is in Doze state
The beam link maintenance timer shall be set to the value of dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime when the
source DMG STA and destination DMG STA successfully complete the BRP if the beam refinement phase
is performed (9.33.3) or the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA successfully complete the SLS
(9.35.2) if the beam refinement phase is skipped as defined in 9.33.3.
A PCP/AP DMG STA shall set the beam link maintenance timer to the value of
dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime when it receives a response from the non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA during
the ATI or when it receives an SPR frame as a response to a Poll frame, if these frames are received using
the beamformed link established with the non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA.
The non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA shall set the beam link maintenance timer to the
dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime when it receives a request from the PCP/AP DMG STA during the ATI
or when it receives a Poll or a Grant frame, if these frames are received using the beamformed link
established with the PCP/AP DMG STA.
The initiator DMG STA shall set the beam link maintenance timer to the dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime
when an immediate response or acknowledgment (ACK, BA, DMG CTS, DMG DTS) has been received
from the recipient DMG STA of the beamformed link.
The recipient DMG STA shall set the beam link maintenance timer to the dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime
after the transmission of the immediate response or acknowledgment (ACK, BA, DMG CTS, DMG DTS)
has been completed to the initiator DMG STA of the beamformed link.
To prevent expiration of the beam link maintenance timer when a DMG STA does not have MSDUs to send,
the DMG STA shall transmit QoS Null frames to maintain a beamformed link.
Following the expiration of the beamlink maintenance time (specified by the current value of the
dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime variable), the destination DMG STA of the SP shall configure its receive
antenna to a quasi-omni antenna pattern for the remainder of the SP and during any SP following the
expiration of the beamlink maintenance time.
Any time after dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime has elapsed, the source DMG STA of the SP may initiate
an ISS to restore the beamformed link with the destination DMG STA of the SP following the rules defined
in 9.35.2. If restoration is desired sooner, the source DMG STA can also initiate the ISS before expiration of
dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime.
The responder DMG STA of the beamformed link in the CBAP shall configure its receive antenna to a
quasi-omni antenna pattern following the expiration of dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime except when it is
involved in a frame exchange with another STA.

Std 802.11ad-2012                                    LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 Any time after dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime has elapsed, the initiator DMG STA of the beamformed
 link in the CBAP may initiate an ISS to restore the beamformed link with the responder STA following the
 rules defined in 9.35.2. If restoration is desired sooner, the initiator STA can also initiate the ISS before
 expiration of dot11BeamLinkMaintenanceTime.
 If a DMG STA detects degradation in the link quality between itself and another DMG STA, the DMG STA
 can use beam tracking or beam refinement to improve the link quality. The DMG STA can request the PCP/
 AP DMG STA to schedule an SP to perform BF with the other DMG STA or use a CBAP to perform BF.
 The DMG STA can use the A-BFT to perform BF if the other DMG STA is its PCP/AP. A PCP/AP DMG
 STA can perform BF with a non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA during a CBAP or by scheduling an SP between
 the PCP/AP DMG STA and the non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA through an Extended Schedule element
 transmitted in a DMG Beacon or Announce frame.
 If the link quality between a PCP/AP DMG STA and a non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA degrades, but the DMG
 STA can still receive DMG Beacon frames with the Next A-BFT field equal to 0, the DMG STA should
 improve the link quality by performing RSS during the A-BFT period as described in 9.35.5.
 A DMG STA may use the value of the parameter LAST_RSSI within the RXVECTOR of a received frame
 to decide to initiate beamforming with a peer DMG STA if the value of the LAST_RSSI parameter is
 different from zero (9.3.2.3.3).
 Figure 10-28 illustrates the operation of the beam link maintenance timer for an example involving STA-A
 and STA-B. In beacon interval n, STA-A and STA-B successfully perform beamforming and set up the
 beam link maintenance timer. In beacon interval n+1, the STAs have two SPs established between them.
 The beam link maintenance timer is halted and released according to the rules described above. Once the
 timer beam link maintenance timer expires, the STAs redo beamforming.

10.28.2 PCP Handover
10.28.2.1 General
A STA is PCP handover capable if the PCP Handover field within the STA’s DMG Capabilities element
(8.4.2.130) is 1. The STA is PCP handover incapable otherwise.
The PCP handover process allows the information pertinent to the operation of the PBSS to be distributed to
suitable PCP handover capable STA(s) and for a PCP handover capable STA to take over the PCP
responsibilities from the PCP explicitly or implicitly.
The information pertinent to the operation of a PBSS includes STA information and pseudo-static
scheduling information.
The STA information is comprised of the STA’s AID, MAC address and DMG Capabilities element. The
PCP may relay the information to all STAs in the PBSS by using the Information Response frame.
The pseudo-static scheduling information comprises pseudo-static SP and CBAP allocations carried in the
Extended Schedule element (8.4.2.134).
A PCP handover capable STA supports two types of PCP Handover, explicit and implicit. In Explicit PCP
Handover, the PCP explicitly selects and schedules the transfer of PCP responsibilities to another PCP
handover capable STA as described in 10.28.2.2. In Implicit PCP Handover the PCP distributes the Next
PCP List element (8.4.2.142) in its DMG Beacon or Announce frames and maintains the content of the
NextPCP List element to facilitate the implicit handover process described in 10.28.2.3. The PCP may
decide the priority of Next PCPs and update the Next PCP List based on information contained within a
STA’s DMG Capabilities element.
If there is at least one PCP handover capable STA in the PBSS, the NextPCP List element contains an
ordered list of one or more PCP handover capable STAs that can take over the role of the PCP during
implicit handover. The ordering of STAs in the NextPCP List is specified in decreasing priority order and
the criteria for updating the NextPCP List are implementation specific. The PCP shall increment the Token
field of the NextPCP List by 1 every time the list is changed. If there are no PCP handover capable STAs in
the PBSS, the length of the NextPCP List element is 0, and Implicit PCP Handover cannot be performed.
When a PCP handover capable STA takes over the PCP responsibilities of a PBSS, the pseudo-static
scheduling information shall remain unchanged. Any outstanding request for resource allocation is lost and
STAs that have outstanding requests for allocation may re-request the resource allocation.
In explicit PCP handover, the PCP shall use the value of the PCP Factor when selecting the candidate PCP
(see 10.1.4.3.4).
Following a PCP handover, non-PCP STAs shall attempt to transmit a frame to the new PCP within
dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals. If the new PCP does not receive at least one frame from an
associated non-PCP STA for dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals following a PCP handover, it should
disassociate the STA from the PBSS.
10.28.2.2 Explicit Handover procedure
The PCP may transmit a Handover Request frame to a non-PCP STA that is handover capable. Upon
receiving a Handover Request, a non-PCP STA becomes the candidate PCP. If the Handover Request is
accepted, the candidate PCP shall transmit a Handover Response frame to the PCP with the Handover Result
field set to 0. If the Handover Request is rejected, the candidate PCP shall transmit a Handover Response
frame to the PCP with the Handover Result field set to 1, 2, or 3 and cease to be the candidate PCP.

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                               LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 A non-PCP STA that is handover capable may transmit a Handover Request frame to the PCP of the PBSS if
 the PCP is handover capable. Upon transmission of the Handover Request frame, the non-PCP STA
 becomes the candidate PCP. If the Handover Request is accepted, the PCP shall transmit a Handover
 Response frame to the candidate PCP with the Handover Result field set to 0. If the Handover Request is
 rejected, the PCP shall transmit a Handover Response frame to the candidate PCP with the Handover Result
 field set to 1, 2, or 3, and the candidate PCP shall cease to be a candidate PCP.
 Following the transmission or reception of a successful Handover Response frame, a candidate PCP should
 request STA information and pseudo-static scheduling information from the PCP using an Information
 Request frame within the next dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons beacon intervals. The candidate PCP should also
 request SPs to perform beamforming and, if appropriate, establish a security association with other
 associated STAs prior to the completion of PCP handover.
 Following the successful reception or transmission of a Handover Response frame, the PCP shall transmit a
 PCP Handover element within every DMG Beacon or Announce frame for each of the next
 dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons beacon intervals with the Old BSSID field set to the BSSID of the PBSS, the
 New PCP Address field set to the MAC address of the candidate PCP, and the Remaining BIs field set to the
 number of beacon intervals remaining until the candidate PCP takes over the role of PCP for the PBSS. The
 initial value of the Remaining BIs field shall be equal to the Remaining BI field value last transmitted by the
 PCP in a Handover Request frame to the candidate PCP or equal to the Remaining BI field value last
 received by the PCP in a Handover Request frame from the candidate PCP, whichever is later. A non-PCP
 STA receiving a DMG Beacon or Announce frame containing the PCP Handover element shall set the
 STA’s local countdown counter to the value of the Remaining BIs field contained in the PCP Handover
 element. The STAs shall then decrease the local countdown counter by one at each TBTT, and shall use the
 candidate PCP’s address contained in the New PCP Address field within the PCP Handover element as the
 new beacon filter address once the STA’s local countdown reaches zero. When the countdown timer equals
 zero, the candidate PCP shall assume the role of PCP.
 10.28.2.3 Implicit Handover procedure
 Upon receiving the NextPCP List element, a PCP handover capable STA that finds its AID as the AID entry
 i in the NextPCP List element received from the PCP becomes the Implicit candidate PCP i. Upon detecting
 a Token value contained in the NextPCP List element that is different from the value of the last Token
 received from the PCP, each Implicit candidate PCP should request STA information and pseudo-static
 scheduling information from the PCP by transmitting an Information Request frame addressed to the PCP
 (10.29.1).
 The implicit handover process is triggered at the Implicit candidate PCP i when the Implicit candidate PCP i
 fails to receive a DMG Beacon or Announce frames from the PCP for (i ×
 dot11ImplicitHandoverLostBeacons) beacon intervals. When triggered, the Implicit candidate PCP i shall
 send at least one DMG Beacon frame during each of the next dot11MaxLostBeacons BTIs if the following
 conditions are met:
    —     No DMG Beacon or Announce frames are received from the PCP.
    —     No DMG Beacon frame carrying a PCP Handover element with the value of the Old BSSID field
          equal to the BSSID of the PBSS is received from an Implicit candidate PCP with a smaller index on
          the NextPCP List.
 Each DMG Beacon sent by the Implicit candidate PCP i shall contain a PCP Handover element with the Old
 BSSID field set to the BSSID of the PBSS from which control is being taken, i.e., the previous PBSS, the
 New PCP Address field set to its MAC address, and the Remaining BIs field initially set to
 dot11MaxLostBeacons and decremented by 1 at each TBTT. A member non-PCP STA of the PBSS, after
 failing to receive a DMG Beacon or Announce frame for dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals, should
 associate with the new PCP sending a DMG Beacon frame containing the PCP Handover element with Old
 386                                                                      Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

BSSID field equal to the BSSID of the previous PBSS and the smallest Remaining BIs field value. The
Implicit candidate PCP that successfully transmits a DMG Beacon with the Remaining BIs field within the
PCP Handover element equal to zero completes the implicit handover by scheduling, if appropriate, pseudo-
static SPs between its member STAs following the pseudo-static scheduling information it obtained from the
previous PBSS.
To avoid disruptions to pseudo-static SPs due to implicit handover, the                           value    of
dot11ImplicitHandoverLostBeacons should be lower than the value of dot11MaxLostBeacons.
10.29 DMG BSS peer and service discovery
10.29.1 Information Request and Response
A STA may request information about either a single STA in the PBSS or about all of the STAs in the PBSS
by sending an Information Request frame (8.5.20.4). If the STA is requesting information about only a
single STA in the PBSS, it shall set the Subject Address field in the Information Request frame to the MAC
address of that STA. If the STA is requesting information about all of the STAs in the PBSS, it shall set the
Subject Address field in the Information Request frame to the broadcast address and shall transmit the
Information Request frame to the PCP.
A STA may transmit an Information Request frame with the length field of the Request element set to 0 to
another STA in the PBSS to determine if the destination DMG STA is still present in the PBSS and is within
range of the sending STA.
A STA may transmit an Information Request frame including its STA Capability element and other
elements. A non-PCP STA shall not include in the Information Request frame the capability information
corresponding to another STA.
The STA may transmit an Information Response frame (8.5.20.5) either unsolicited or as a response to an
Information Request frame. If a STA is providing information about a single STA in the PBSS, it shall set
the Subject Address field in the Information Response frame to the MAC address of that STA. If a STA is
providing information about all of the STAs in the PBSS, it shall set the Subject Address field in the
Information Response frame to the broadcast address.
A STA shall include in the Information Response frame the elements requested by the originator STA.
A STA shall send an Information Response frame with an empty payload in response to a received
Information Request frame that solicits information about a single target STA if
   —     The target STA is not a member of the PBSS and the STA sending the Information Response frame
         is the PCP of the PBSS, or
   —     The target STA is not the STA sending the Information Response frame.
In all other cases, the STA shall send the Information Response frame with the information requested by the
requesting STA.
10.29.2 Peer Service Discovery
A PCP/AP may provide different types of information to a non-PCP/non-AP STA upon request. To query
available services in a BSS, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall send either an Information Request frame or a
Probe Request frame to the PCP/AP (10.29.1). The Information Request and Information Response frames
are robust management frames, while the Probe Request and Probe Response frames are not.
Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.                                                              387
IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                                 LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 Upon receiving the Information Request frame, the PCP/AP shall respond with an Information Response
 only if all of the following three criteria are true:
    a)     The SSID in the Information Request is the wildcard SSID or the specific SSID of the PCP/AP.
    b)     The BSSID field in the Information Request is the wildcard BSSID or the BSSID of the PCP/AP.
    c)     The DA field in the Information Request is the MAC address of the PCP/AP.
 The PCP/AP transmits the Information Response frame to the address of the non-PCP/non-AP STA that
 generated the Information Request.
 The Information Response frame may include vendor-specific elements.
 10.30 Changing DMG BSS parameters
 10.30.1 General
 This subclause describes the methods used by the PCP/AP to change certain key characteristics of the BSS.
 It also describes a method for a non-PCP/non-AP STA to make a recommendation on those characteristics to
 the PCP/AP.
 The PCP/AP delivers the DMG BSS Parameter Change element to STAs holding pseudo-static SPs and
 STAs in power save mode before a DMG BSS parameter change.
 The PCP/AP shall initiate a DMG BSS parameter change by including a DMG BSS Parameter Change
 element (8.4.2.129) in its DMG Beacon or Announce frames. The PCP/AP places the DMG BSS Parameter
 Change element in every DMG Beacon or Announce frame after the DMG BSS Parameter Change element
 is first included in the frame, stopping in the DMG Beacon or Announce frame immediately after the DMG
 BSS parameter change takes effect.
 10.30.2 Moving the TBTT
 The PCP/AP may move the TBTT and hence move the entire beacon interval. Moving the beacon interval
 means that except for the beacon interval in which the change takes effect, the beacon interval duration is
 unchanged while the position of the TBTT is moved.
 The TBTT shall not be moved by an amount that is larger than the value in the Beacon Interval field present
 in DMG Beacon and Announce frames in which the DMG BSS Parameter Change element is sent.
 To move the TBTT to an intended new TBTT, the PCP/AP shall insert the DMG BSS Parameter Change
 element in DMG Beacon frames and/or Announce frames with the Move field set to 1 (8.4.2.129). The
 DMG Beacon frames and/or the Announce frames containing the DMG BSS Parameter Change element
 shall be sent at each TBTT dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons times before the TBTT is changed as indicated in
 the TBTT offset field.
 At each transmission of the DMG BSS Parameter Change element, the TBTT Offset field shall be set to a
 value equal to the lower order 4 octets of the intended new TBTT.
 The value of dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons shall be greater than dot11MaxLostBeacons.
 NOTE—As defined in 10.1.2.1, the PCP transmits at least one DMG Beacon frame to each associated STA within a time
 interval that is not longer than dot11BeaconPeriod × dot11MaxLostBeacons TUs.
 Announce frames shall be used to deliver the DMG BSS Parameter Change element to all STAs
 participating in pseudo-static SPs.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                  Std 802.11ad-2012
The value of the Beacon Interval field of DMG Beacon frames and the Announce frames sent at the
dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons+1 TBTT shall be set to the difference of the intended new TBTT and the TBTT
where the DMG Beacon or Announce frames were sent.
STAs associated with a PCP/AP that moves the TBTT shall not transmit during the beacon interval that
precedes a new TBTT if the transmission time ends at the TBTT or later, even if the SP or the CBAP were
scheduled in the beacon interval.
At the intended new TBTT that is dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons+2 TBTTs after the DMG BSS Parameter
Change element is first transmitted, the TSF timer is reset to 0 as defined in 10.1.3.2a.
A PCP/AP member of a PCP/AP cluster that wishes to move its TBTT shall set the TBTT Offset field to an
empty Beacon SP allocated by its S-PCP/S-AP as defined in 9.34.
Figure 10-29 illustrates the process in moving the TBTT position.

10.30.3 Changing beacon interval duration
The PCP/AP may change the duration of its beacon interval during the BSS operation.
To change its beacon interval, the PCP/AP shall insert the DMG BSS Parameter Change element into DMG
Beacon frames and/or Announce frames with the Size field set to 1 and the BI Duration field set to the
duration of the beacon interval following this DMG BSS parameter change. The TBTT Offset field shall be
set to the lower order 4 octets of the TBTT at dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons+1 TBTT position when this
DMG BSS parameter change takes effect.
The DMG Beacon frames and/or the Announce frames shall be sent at each TBTT
dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons times before the beacon interval is changed as indicated in the BI Duration field
of the DMG BSS Parameter Change element.
At each transmission of the DMG BSS Parameter Change element the TBTT Offset field shall be set to a
value equal to the lower order 4 octets of the intended TBTT.
The value of dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons shall be greater than dot11MaxLostBeacons.
Announce frames shall be used to deliver the DMG BSS Parameter Change element to all STAs
participating in pseudo-static SPs.

 The PCP/AP that shortens the beacon interval shall not schedule SP and CBAP allocations that use more
 time than allowed in the beacon interval indicated in the BI Duration field of the DMG BSS Parameter
 Change element.
 The value of the beacon interval shall be set to the BI Duration field of the DMG BSS Parameter Change
 element at the dot11NbrOfChangeBeacons+1 TBTT. At this TBTT, the TSF timer is reset to 0 as defined in
 10.1.3.2a.
 If the PCP/AP sets the Move and the Size fields to 1 in the same DMG BSS Parameter Change element, it
 shall set the TBTT Offset field and proceed as defined in 10.30.2. The value of the beacon interval shall be
 set to the BI Duration field of the DMG BSS Parameter Change element at the new TBTT as defined in
 10.30.2.

 10.30.4 Maintaining synchronization in a PCP/AP cluster
 A S-PCP/S-AP shall update the Clustering Control field transmitted in the DMG Beacon if the DMG BSS
 parameter change modifies the allocation of the Beacon SPs (9.34). If the Clustering Control field is
 modified as a result of a DMG BSS parameter change, the S-PCP/S-AP shall transmit the updated
 Clustering Control field in every DMG Beacon in which the DMG BSS Parameter Change element is
 transmitted.
 A PCP/AP member of a PCP/AP cluster receiving a S-PCP/S-AP DMG Beacon with a DMG BSS Parameter
 Change element indicating a change in the beacon interval duration or TBTT time shall immediately insert
 the appropriate DMG BSS Parameter Change element into its DMG Beacons if the S-PCP/S-AP’s DMG
 BSS parameter change causes a modification in the allocation of the Beacon SPs.
 If a PCP/AP is required to change the beacon interval or/and TBTT to participate in a PCP/AP cluster or to
 change the beacon interval or/and TBTT as a result of its S-PCP/S-AP’s parameters change (see 9.34), it
 shall follow the procedures in 10.30.2 and 10.30.3.
 10.30.5 Recommending DMG BSS parameters to the PCP/AP
 A non-PCP/non-AP STA may make a recommendation for DMG BSS parameters to the PCP/AP by
 including a DMG BSS Parameter Change element in an Information Request or Information Response
 frame sent to the PCP/AP.
 A non-PCP/non-AP STA may recommend a shift in TBTT by setting the Move subfield in the Change Type
 Bitmap field of the DMG BSS Parameter Change element to 1 and setting the TBTT Offset field to the lower
 390                                                                   Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.

order 4 octets of the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s TSF timer at the recommended first changed TBTT. The non-
PCP/non-AP should select a value for the TBTT Offset field that gives the PCP/AP enough time to exercise
the change. Similarly, a non-PCP/non-AP STA may recommend a beacon interval duration to the PCP/AP
by setting the Size subfield in the Change Type Bitmap field of the DMG BSS Parameter Change element to
1 and setting the BI Duration field to the recommended beacon interval duration in TUs.
A PCP/AP that receives an Information Request or an unsolicited Information Response frame from a non-
PCP/non-AP STA containing a DMG BSS Parameter Change element may use the information within the
element to change the DMG BSS parameters. When receiving an Information Request frame that includes
the DMG BSS Parameter Change element, PCP/AP responds with an Information Response frame as
specified in 10.29.1. If the PCP/AP changes the BSS parameters in the transmitted Information Response
frame, the PCP/AP shall include a DMG BSS Parameter Change element reflecting the BSS parameter
changes and shall use the procedure defined in 10.30.2 and 10.30.3, as appropriate, to change the BSS
parameters. If the PCP/AP decides not to change the BSS parameters, it shall not include a DMG BSS
Parameter Change element in the transmitted Information Response frame.
10.31 Spatial sharing and interference mitigation for DMG STAs
10.31.1 General
This subclause describes mechanisms to enable spatial sharing and interference mitigation within a PBSS/
infrastructure BSS and in a uncoordinated OBSS environment.
Spatial sharing mechanisms allow SPs belonging to different STAs in the same spatial vicinity to be
scheduled concurrently over the same channel, and for interference mitigation. Alternatively, the PCP/AP
can use CBAPs to mitigate interference.
The SPSH and Interference Mitigation field in the DMG Capabilities element indicates whether a STA
supports spatial sharing.
A STA that supports spatial sharing, as indicated in the SPSH and Interference Mitigation field equal to 1 in
the STA’s DMG Capabilities element, shall support the directional channel quality measurements described
in 8.4.2.23.16 and 8.4.2.24.15.
10.31.2 Spatial sharing and interference assessment
The PCP/AP should request STAs to perform and report spectrum and radio resource measurements
described in 10.11 to assess the possibility to perform spatial sharing and for interference mitigation.
The PCP/AP should use the directional channel quality described in 8.4.2.23.16 and 8.4.2.24.15 to assess the
possibility for spatial sharing of SPs.
An SP to be assessed for spatial sharing with other scheduled (existing) SPs or considered to be reallocated
in the beacon interval is hereby termed as a candidate SP. There might be multiple candidate and existing
SPs at one time, and an SP may simultaneously assume the role of candidate and existing SP depending
upon the context it is used for spatial sharing and interference assessment.
STAs that participate in an SP and that support spatial sharing should perform beamforming training with
each other before engaging in any other communication or performing any measurements described in this
subclause.
The PCP/AP should request source DMG STA and destination DMG STA involved in a candidate SP to
perform measurements for the purpose of spatial sharing with an existing SP only after the STAs have

 beamforming trained with each other. The PCP/AP can infer that the STAs in a candidate SP have a
 beamformed link with each other if the Beamforming Training field within the DMG TSPEC used to set up
 the candidate SP was set to 1 and at least one beacon interval has elapsed since the candidate SP was first
 scheduled.
 If the PCP/AP transmits a Directional Channel Quality Request to a STA involved in a candidate SP to
 assess the possibility for spatial sharing with another existing SP, it shall set the Target STA to the
 corresponding peer STA’s MAC address involved in the candidate SP and shall set the Measurement
 Method field to indicate ANIPI.
 If the candidate SP has already been allocated channel time, the PCP/AP should additionally transmit a
 Directional Channel Quality Request to the STAs involved in the existing SP to assess the possibility for
 spatial sharing with the candidate SP. In the Directional Channel Quality Request, the PCP/AP shall set the
 Target STA to the corresponding peer STA involved in the existing SP and shall set the Measurement
 Method field to indicate ANIPI.
 NOTE—When the PCP/AP transmits a directional channel quality request to a STA of an existing SP, it intends to
 assess the channel quality during transmission by STAs belonging to the candidate SP. Similarly, when the PCP/AP
 transmits a directional channel quality request to a STA of a candidate SP, it intends to assess the channel quality during
 transmission by STAs belonging to the existing SP.
 If a recipient STA that receives a Directional Channel Quality Request frame is already beamformed trained
 with the target STA specified by the AID field within the frame, then the recipient STA shall carry out the
 measurement employing the same receive antenna configuration as is used by the recipient STA when
 receiving frames from the target STA. If the AID field is set to the broadcast AID or an unknown AID, then
 the recipient STA shall perform the measurements using a quasi-omni antenna pattern.
 Figure 10-31 illustrates an example of spatial sharing assessment between two SPs. In this example, SP1 is
 the existing SP and SP2 is the candidate SP. The PCP/AP transmits a Directional Channel Quality Request
 to STAs C and D to measure over SP1’s channel allocation, and transmits a Directional Channel Quality
 Request to STAs A and B to measure over SP2’s channel allocation. The relation of the Measurement Start
 Time and Measurement Duration fields in the Directional Channel Quality Request message is shown in
 Figure 10-31, while the field Number of Time Blocks is the ratio (Measurement Duration/Measurement
 Unit).

If a non-PCP/non-AP STA receives a Directional Channel Quality Request from its PCP/AP, it should
perform the measurements as indicated in the request and shall report back to the PCP/AP using the
Directional Channel Quality Report. The report shall be formatted and transmitted as per specified in the
Directional Channel Quality Request. The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall set the Report Mode field (8.4.2.24)
in the report frame to indicate whether it performed the measurement as requested by the PCP/AP.
10.31.3 Achieving spatial sharing and interference mitigation
A PCP/AP can estimate the channel quality across STAs participating in the BSS and implement spatial
sharing and interference mitigation based on the results of the measurements performed by the STAs
associated with the PCP/AP.
A PCP/AP should schedule a candidate SP that overlaps with an existing SP in its beacon interval only after
it receives a Directional Channel Quality Report from the STAs involved in the candidate SP.
If a candidate SP is already scheduled in the beacon interval, the PCP/AP should schedule this candidate SP
time-overlapping with an existing SP in its beacon interval only after it receives a Directional Channel
Quality Report from the STAs involved in the existing SP.
The PCP/AP should schedule a candidate SP during a period of time in the beacon interval where the PBSS/
infrastructure BSS performance is expected to be maximized. The determination of performance
maximization should be based on measurement reports received by the PCP/AP, but is implementation
dependent and beyond the scope of this standard.
The decision process at the PCP/AP to perform spatial sharing of a candidate and an existing SP is
implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this standard.
The candidate SP is referred to as a Time-Overlapped SP following the allocation by the PCP/AP of a
candidate SP overlapping in time with an existing SP.
Figure 10-32 illustrates an example of the resulting SP schedule in the beacon interval for the spatial sharing
between the two SPs shown in Figure 10-31.

The PCP/AP should periodically transmit a Directional Channel Quality Request to each spatial sharing
capable STA involved in a Time-Overlapped and existing SP scheduled under spatial sharing. In the
Directional Channel Quality Request that the PCP/AP transmits to each STA, the PCP/AP shall set the
Target STA to the peer STA involved in the same SP and shall set the Measurement Method field to indicate
RSNI.
If a spatial sharing capable non-PCP/non-AP STA receives a Directional Channel Quality Request from its
PCP/AP, it should perform the measurements as indicated in the request and shall report the results back to
the PCP/AP using the Directional Channel Quality Report. The report shall be formatted and transmitted as
per specified in the corresponding Directional Channel Quality Request.

 The PCP/AP should stop the spatial sharing of two or more SPs if it determines that the link quality of any of
 the links involved in the spatial sharing has dropped below acceptable levels. This determination should be
 based on Directional Channel Quality Reports received by the PCP/AP, but is implementation dependent
 and beyond the scope of this standard.
 The STA may include the TSCONST field with the ADDTS Request sent to the PCP/AP for the purpose of
 interference mitigation. The PCP/AP should consider the information in the TSCONST field specified by a
 STA in its SP schedule.
 Specific algorithms to realize spatial sharing and interference mitigation among SPs between different STAs
 is implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this standard.
 10.31.4 PBSS and infrastructure BSS stability in OBSS scenarios
 Except when performing FST (10.32), the PCP/AP limits the frequency with which it changes the operating
 PBSS/infrastructure BSS channel to alleviate the instability and ripple effect that might result from frequent
 channel changes in OBSS scenarios. Upon a channel switch, the PCP/AP of a PBSS/infrastructure BSS shall
 select a random number, N, uniformly distributed between [0, SwitchInterval-1] and shall not attempt a new
 channel switch until N beacon intervals have elapsed since the preceding channel switch. The initial value of
 SwitchInterval is aMinSwitchInterval and it is doubled upon every new channel switch up to a maximum
 value of aMaxSwitchInterval. The PCP/AP resets SwitchInterval to aMinSwitchInterval if it remains on the
 same operating channel for a minimum of aMaxSwitchInterval consecutive beacon intervals.
 NOTE—The PCP/AP can keep the SP schedule stable across beacon intervals and minimize schedule changes. This is to
 allow for STAs to associate with the PBSS/infrastructure BSS or add or modify their SP reservations. Stability in the
 allocation schedule in a beacon interval allows a PBSS/infrastructure BSS to assess the interference pattern produced by
 OBSSs and adapt to the environment by scheduling SPs over periods of time in the beacon interval when less
 interference is expected.
 10.32 Multi-band operation
 10.32.1 General
 A device is multi-band capable if the value of its local MIB variable dot11MultibandImplemented is true. A
 multi-band capable device is said to be a member of a BSS when one or more of the STAs in the device is a
 member of the BSS. A STA that is part of a multi-band capable device advertises the capability by including
 the Multi-band element in Beacon, DMG Beacon, (Re)Association Request, (Re)Association Response,
 Information Request, Information Response, Probe Request, Probe Response, Announce, FST Setup
 Request, FST Setup Response, TDLS Discovery Request, TDLS Discovery Response, TDLS Setup
 Request, and TDLS Setup Response frames.
 Except for the FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frames, which shall not include more than one
 Multi-band element, a STA may include more than one Multi-band element in any one of these frames if it is
 part of a device that supports more than two bands or channels. If a PCP/AP includes one or more Multi-
 band elements within a (Re)Association Response frame with Status Code equal to
 DENIED_WITH_SUGGESTED_BAND_AND_CHANNEL or a Probe Response frame, the order in which
 these elements appear in the frame indicate the order, in terms of frequency band and channel number, that
 the device that includes the STA addressed by the frame should attempt join the BSS following the rules
 applicable to the respective frequency band and channel (see 10.1). For each Multi-band element contained
 in the frame starting from the first one and proceeding in increasing order, the STA should attempt to join
 the BSS using the BSSID indicated by the BSSID field, frequency band indicated by the Band ID field and
 channel number indicated by the Channel Number field provided the Beacon Interval and the Channel
 Number fields in the Multi-band element are both nonzero.
 NOTE—The first Multi-band element in the frame can refer to the current operating frequency band and channel.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                     Std 802.11ad-2012
A multi-band capable device shall set the Band ID and Operating Class fields within a Multi-band element
to specify a frequency band it supports. If the multi-band capable device is or intends to operate in the band
indicated within the Multi-band element, it shall set the Channel Number field to indicate the channel of
operation within that band. If the multi-band capable device is a member of a BSS both on the channel
indicated in the Channel Number field within the Multi-band element and also in the channel on which this
element is transmitted, then the multi-band capable device shall set the TSF Offset field within a Multi-band
element to the difference between the TSF of the BSS of which the STA is member on the channel indicated
in the Channel Number field of this element and the TSF of the BSS corresponding to the BSSID indicated
in the Address 3 field of the MPDU in which this element is transmitted. In all other cases, the TSF Offset
field shall be set to 0.
The FST session transition is managed by FST session setup protocol. A multi-band capable device
participates as an initiator or as a responder in the FST session setup. Depending on the STA’s behavior
during the FST session setup, the FST session can be operational in one band, or may be transferred to
another band or channel in the same band, or can be operational in multiple bands and/or channels
simultaneously and in this case MSDUs can be transmitted in different bands and/or channels any time an
MSDU arrives at the MAC SAP. If a multi-band capable device is operational in more than one band/
channel simultaneously, the STA may use the FST session setup protocol to change the operation to a single
channel.
An FST session between an initiator and a responder is identified by an FSTS ID. The value of the FSTS ID
is allocated by the initiator of an FST session and shall remain unchanged whether the FST session is
operational in one band or more than one band simultaneously. The value of the FSTS ID shall be unique for
an initiator and responder pair, and there shall be no more than one FST session between an initiator and
responder pair. If an initiator or responder desires to change the FSTS ID of its existing FST session, it shall
tear down the existing FST session (10.32.3) and set up a new one with a different FSTS ID value.
In each band/channel, a multi-band capable device may use the same or different MAC addresses. When the
STA MAC Address Present field is 1 in a Multi-band element, the STA MAC Address field in the Multi-
band element specifies the MAC address that the STA uses in the band and channel that are indicated in the
Multi-band element. If the STA MAC Address Present field is 0, the MAC address that the STA uses in the
frequency band and channel that are indicated in the Multi-band element is the same as the address the STA
uses in the current operating band and channel.
The FST session addressing mode is Transparent if both initiator and responder of the FST session use the
same MAC address in the frequency bands/channels involved in the FST session transfer. The FST session
addressing mode is Nontransparent if either the initiator or responder use different MAC addresses in the
different frequency bands/channels involved in the FST session. When transparent FST is used, the STA
shall present a single MAC-SAP to higher layers for all frequency bands/channels in which it uses that MAC
address.
An FST is allowed if the FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frames are permitted to be transmitted
as indicated in 10.3.3.
A multi-band capable device should deliver all fragments, if any, of an MSDU of an FST session before it
transfers the FST session.
A multi-band capable device shall include, in any transmitted FST Setup Request and in any transmitted
FST Setup Response, the capabilities element, the operation element, the EDCA Parameter Set element,
Supported Rates element, Extended Supported Rates element, and Supported Channels element that are
applicable to the band and channel number indicated within its most recently transmitted Multi-band
element that was transmitted on the same band and channel number on which it is transmitting the FST
Setup Request or FST Setup Response frames. If a Multi-band element is present in the transmitted FST

 Setup Request or FST Setup Response frames, the Multi-band element is considered as the most recently
 transmitted Multi-band element.
 If a Session Transition element and a Multi-band element are present in the same frame and the values of the
 Operating Class and Channel Number fields within the Multi-band element are both nonzero, the value of
 the Band ID field related to the new band within the Session Transition element shall be the same as the
 Band ID field within the Multi-band element.
 10.32.2 FST setup protocol
 10.32.2.1 General
 The FST setup protocol comprises four states and rules for how to move from one state to the next. The
 states are Initial, Setup Completion, Transition Done, and Transition Confirmed. In the Initial state, the FST
 session is operational in one or both bands/channels. In the Setup Completion state, both initiator and
 responder are ready to change their currently operating band(s)/channel(s). An FST session can be fully or
 partially transferred to another band/channel or transferred back to one band/channel. The Transition Done
 state enables both initiator and responder to operate in the other band/channel if the value of the LLT was
 zero. Both initiator and responder have to successfully communicate in the new band/channel to reach the
 Transition Confirmed state. The state transition diagram of the FST setup protocol is shown in Figure 10-34.
 Figure 10-33 depicts the procedure of the FST setup protocol that drives the state machine shown in
 Figure 10-34. The figure is only an example of the basic procedure and is not meant to be exhaustive of all
 possible uses of the protocol. In the figure, MLME 1 and MLME 2 represent any two MLMEs of a multi-
 band capable device according to the reference model described in 4.9.4. In addition, the parameter n
 corresponds to the number of FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frame exchanges until both the
 FST initiator and FST responder successfully move to the Setup Completion state, as described below.
 To establish an FST session in the Initial state and transfer it to the Setup Completion state of the FST setup
 protocol (Figure 10-34), an initiator and responder shall exchange FST Setup Request and FST Setup
 Response frames. An FST session exists in Setup Completion state, Transition Done state, or Transition
 Confirmed state. In the Initial and in the Setup Completion states, the old band/channel represents the
 frequency band/channel from which the FST session is to be transferred, and the new band/channel
 represents the frequency band/channel to which the FST session is to be transferred. In the Transition Done
 state, the new band/channel represents the frequency band/channel from which the FST Ack Request and
 FST Ack Response frames, if any, are transmitted, and the old band/channel represents the frequency band/
 channel from which the FST session is being transferred.
 The responder shall set the Status Code field to SUCCESS if it accepts the FST Setup Request, shall set the
 Status Code to REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES (see 8.4.1.9) to indicate that one or more
 parameters of the FST Setup Request are invalid and shall suggest alternative parameters, shall set the Status
 Code to PENDING_ADMITTING_FST_SESSION or PENDING_GAP_IN_BA_WINDOW to indicate
 that an FST Setup Request is pending, and shall set the Status Code field to 37 (“The request has been
 declined”) to reject an FST Setup Request.
 A responder that is also an enabling STA (see 10.12) may set the Status Code to REJECT_DSE_BAND to
 indicate that the FST Setup Request is rejected because it was initiated by a dependent STA (see 10.12) that
 is requesting transition to a frequency band subject to DSE procedures. In this case, if the responder is the
 enabling STA for the dependent STA, the responder may include a Timeout Interval element in the FST
 Setup Response frame to indicate the period in TUs before which it initiates an FST Setup with the
 dependent STA. The Timeout Interval Type field within the Timeout Interval element shall be set to 4. The
 responder can use the parameters in the FST Setup Request frame received from the dependent STA to
 initiate an FST Setup with the initiator.

10.32.2.2 Transitioning between states
A state transition within the FST setup protocol is controlled by the State Transition Timer (STT). Each STA
maintains a STT for each FST session. The STAs shall move to the Initial state when the STT moves from 1
to 0 (other than set to 0) or upon reception or transmission of an FST Tear Down frame.

 The responder shall set the STT to the value of the FSTSessionTimeOut field at successful transmission of
 an FST Setup Response frame. The responder shall set the STT to 0 at each transmission of an ACK frame
 sent in response to the reception of an FST Setup Request. The responder should send an FST Setup
 Response frame no later than FSTSessionTimeOut after the transmission of an ACK frame sent in response
 to a received FST Setup Request frame or successful transmission of an FST Setup Response frame with the
 status        code           field           equal       to                PENDING_ADMITTING_FST_SESSION                           or
 PENDING_GAP_IN_BA_WINDOW. In the latter case, the responder shall transmit the unsolicited FST
 Setup Response frame to the initiator.
 There might be multiple FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frame transmissions by the initiator
 and the responder, respectively, until the FST session between these STAs becomes established. At each
 transition, or attempt to transition, from the Initial state to the Setup Completion state, the initiator and
 responder shall perform the following procedure:
          1)    The initiator sends an FST Setup Request frame to the responder.
          2)    Upon receipt of an FST Setup Request frame, the responder shall respond with an FST Setup
                Response frame unless it has a pending FST Setup Request frame addressed to the initiator and
                the responder has a numerically larger MAC address than the initiator’s MAC address, in
                which case, the responder shall delete the received FST Setup Request.
          3)    If, after the reception of the acknowledgment to the initiator’s FST Setup Request frame, the
                initiator receives an FST Setup Request frame from the responder, the initiator shall not
                respond with an FST Setup Response frame if its MAC address is numerically larger (see

              smaller than the responder’s MAC address, it becomes the responder and responds with the
              FST Setup Response frame and shall not send the FST Setup Request frame during the current
              FST session transition.
          4)  The initiator shall not move to the Setup Completion state if at least one of the following
              conditions is met:
              a)   The initiator does not successfully receive an FST Setup Response frame from the
                   responder within the STT.
              b)   The value of the Status Code field in the received FST Setup Response frame from the
                   responder is different from SUCCESS.
              c)   A state-specific exception in Table 10-15 takes place.
          5)  The initiator shall move to the Setup Completion state if none of conditions 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)
              is met.
          6)  The responder shall not move to the Setup Completion state if at least one of the following
              conditions is met:
              a)   The responder does not receive the acknowledgment to its transmitted FST Setup
                   Response frame
              b)   The value of the Status Code field in the FST Setup Response frame it transmitted to the
                   initiator was different from SUCCESS
              c)   The value of the Setup and Operation subfields within the Session Transition element in
                   the transmitted FST Setup Response frame results in a status different from any of the
                   rows shown in Figure 10-16, in which case the responder shall set the Status Code field
                   with the transmitted FST Setup Response to 37 (“The request has been declined”)
              d)   The resulting status of the Operation subfield in the New Band field is 0.
          7)  The responder shall move to the Setup Completion state if none of conditions 6(a), 6(b), 6(c)
              and 6(d) is met.

     —      If the last FST Setup Request or FST Setup Response frames exchanged between the initiator and

            element that have the LLT Type field set to 1 shall be switched using the Stream-based Link Loss

     —      If the neither the FST Setup Request nor the FST Setup Response frames exchanged between the
            initiator and responder included a Switching Stream element, then the streams shall be switched
            using the STA-based Link Loss Countdown.
 The FST transition for the STA, if STA-based, or the stream, if stream-based, from the Setup Completion
 state to the Transition Done state shall occur immediately after the corresponding Link Loss countdown

 An initiator and responder shall perform the STA-based and stream-based Link Loss Countdown as follows:
     —      STA-based Link Loss Countdown: Both initiator and responder shall remain in the Setup

            Link Loss countdown is reloaded with the value of LLT×32 μs every time that an individually
            addressed frame is received from the peer STA of the FST session.
     —      Stream-based Link Loss Countdown: Both the initiator and responder shall start a Link Loss
            countdown timer with an initial value of LLT×32 μs for each stream identified within the Switching
            Stream element. The Link Loss countdown for a stream is reloaded with the value of LLT×32 μs

shall perform the following procedure within the channel number of the operating class and band ID
specified in the Multi-band element negotiated during the FST session setup:

    a)    The State transition is controlled by the State Transition Timer (STT). Each STA of the FST session
          has its own STT. The initiator and responder shall move to the Initial state when the STT moves
          from 1 to 0 (other than set to 0).
          The initiator shall set the STT to the value of the FSTSessionTimeOut field at successful
          transmission of an FST Ack Request frame or at transmission of any individually addressed MPDU
          to responder. The initiator shall set the STT to zero at the transmission of an ACK sent in response to
          a received FST Ack Response from the responder or at reception of an ACK frame received in
          response to a frame sent to the responder.
          The responder shall set the STT to FSTSessionTimeOut at transmission of an FST Ack Response
          frame or at transmission of any other individually addressed MPDU to the initiator. The responder
          shall set the STT to zero at reception of an ACK frame received in response to a transmitted FST
          Ack Response frame or at the reception of any individually addressed frame sent by the initiator.
          The responder shall transmit an FST Ack Response frame to the initiator no later than
          FSTSessionTimeOut after the transmission of an ACK frame sent in response to a received FST Ack
          Request from the initiator.
    b)    The SME of both the initiator and responder generates an MLME-FSTIncoming.request primitive
          that includes the parameters of the FST session transfer. This primitive shall be generated to the
          MLME associated with the channel number, operating class, and band ID specified in the Multi-
          band element negotiated during the FST session setup. This primitive notifies the MLME of an
          impending FST session transfer.
    c)    The initiator shall send an FST Ack Request frame or may send any other individually addressed A-
          MPDU, MPDU, or MMPDU to the responder.
          NOTE—Depending on the BSS configuration in the new band/channel, the initiator might have to associate
          and/or authenticate with the BSS before it is allowed to transmit a frame to the responder.
    d)    Upon receipt of an FST Ack Request frame, the responder shall respond to the initiator with an FST
          Ack Response frame.
          NOTE—Depending on the BSS configuration in the new band/channel, the responder might have to associate
          and/or authenticate with the BSS before it is allowed to transmit a frame to the initiator.
    e)    The initiator shall move to the Transition Confirmed state
          1)    Upon transmission of an ACK frame sent in response to any individually addressed frame,
                including an FST Ack Response frame, received from the responder; or
          2)    When the initiator receives an ACK frame from the responder to any non-FST Ack Request
                frame the initiator transmitted to the responder.
    f)    The responder shall move to the Transition Confirmed state
          1)    When the responder receives an ACK frame in response to any individually addressed frame,
                including an FST Ack Response frame, sent to the initiator; or
          2)    Upon transmission of an ACK frame sent in response to any individually addressed non-FST
                Ack Request frame.
 Following the transition to the Transition Confirmed state, a STA shall adopt the role indicated in the STA
 Role field corresponding to the channel number, operating class and band ID that was last transmitted to the
 peer STA within the Multi-band element. If the STA operated within a PBSS was the initiator of the FST
 session and the new role of the STA is as an IBSS STA, then the STA shall be a DFS Owner of the IBSS.
 In case the transition to the Transition Confirmed state was the result of a Stream-based Link Loss
 Countdown, the stream shall remain in the Transition Confirmed state until all the streams included within
 the corresponding Switching Stream element reach the Transition Confirmed state. Once all streams within
 the corresponding Switching Stream element reach the Transition Confirmed state or the FST session ceases
 to exist, the STA moves to the Initial state.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                      Std 802.11ad-2012
If neither the initiator nor the responder perform in the role of PCP or AP as indicated through the STA Role
field within the Multi-band element corresponding to the new band for that STA, one of the STAs can
initialize a new BSS (10.1, Annex R) on the new band for communication between the STAs.
If the value of the Switch intent field in the last Session Transition element transmitted to a responder is 1,
an initiator may switch to the new band and channel indicated in the last transmitted FST Setup Request
frame and Multi-band element, respectively, if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
   —     The value of the Status Code field within the FST Setup Response frame received in response to the
         transmitted FST Setup Request frame is equal to 37 (“The request has been declined”).
   —     The initiator moves to the Initial state due to the STT at the initiator moving from 1 to 0.
   —     The initiator moves to the Initial state due to the reception of an FST Tear Down frame from the
         responder.
Immediately before a initiator switches to a new band and/or channel, the initiator shall disassociate and
delete all TS and BA agreement(s) it has with a responder for which at least one of the above conditions is
met.
Following the successful FST transition to a new band, the STA of the FST session shall follow the medium
access rules applicable on the new band.
10.32.2.3 FST TS switching
If a STA transmitting an FST Setup Request or an FST Setup Response does not intend to switch all its
streams, then the STA shall include the Switching Stream element in the transmitted frame to indicate which
streams are requested to be transferred to the other band/channel. If the FST Setup Request frame includes a
Switching Stream element, the FST Setup Response frame should include a Switching Stream element. If
the FST Setup Request frame does not include a Switching Stream element, the FST Setup Response frame
may include a Switching Stream element. If the STA transmitting the Switching Stream element has not set
up a stream in the band indicated in the New Band ID field within this element, it shall set the Stream ID in
New Band Valid field to 0. A STA may set up a stream in any band/channel by transmitting ADDBA
Request or ADDTS Request frames that include the Multi-band element.
If a STA transmits an ADDTS Request frame to another STA with which it has established an FST session
and the ADDTS Request frame is transmitted in a band or channel different from the band or channel to
which the ADDTS Request is intended to apply, the ADDTS Request frame shall include the Multi-band
element with the Band ID, Operating Class, and Channel Number fields set to indicate to which channel the
ADDTS Request frame applies. In addition, if these STAs use the nontransparent mode for FST session
transfer, the STA transmitting the ADDTS Request frame sets the STA MAC Address Present field to 1 and
the STA MAC Address field to the MAC address that the STA uses in the band and channel number that are
indicated in the Multi-band element contained in the ADDTS Request frame. Similar to the ADDTS
Request frame, the Multi-band element shall be included in the ADDBA Request, ADDTS Response,
ADDBA Response, DELTS, and DELBA frames when these frames are transmitted in a band or channel
different from the band or channel to which they are intended to apply.
When using transparent mode to transfer an FST session corresponding to a TID/TSID, the Direction
subfield within the TSPEC element, if any, used to set up the TID/TSID should not be set to indicate a
bidirectional link. This enables the SME to use the TID/TSID in conjunction with the source and destination
MAC addresses in both the old and new frequency band/channel to uniquely identify the FST session.
If any of the ADDTS variants is used to switch the TS, the PTP TSPEC or the DMG TSPEC shall be used
when the TS is being established to operate in a DMG BSS, and the Basic TSPEC shall be used when the TS
is being established to operate in a non-DMG BSS irrespective of the band and channel used to
communicate the ADDTS frames and the DMG ADDTS frames.

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                               LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 The rules defined below apply when the ADDTS frames or the DMG ADDTS frames are used to switch TS.
 When the ADDTS frames and the DMG ADDTS frames are used, then the ADDTS requester and the
 ADDTS responder provide the functions defined for the ADDBA Originator and the ADDBA Recipient,
 respectively.
 If the ADDBA Recipient includes the Switching Stream element in any of the FST Setup Request or FST
 Setup Response frames and if the Stream ID in New Band Valid field within the Switching Stream element
 is 0, the ADDBA Originator should issue the DELBA frame to reject the BA agreements indicated in the
 Stream ID in Old Band field. If the Originator intends to establish new BA agreements in the band indicated
 in the Multi-band element sent by the Recipient and with the Recipient MAC address indicated in the Multi-
 band element sent by the Recipient, the Originator shall transmit an ADDBA Request frame addressed to the
 Recipient.
 The Originator may include the Multi-band element and the Ethernet type TCLAS element in the ADDBA
 request frame. If the MAC Addresses of the Originator and Recipient to be used in the new band are
 different from the MAC addresses used in the old band, then the ADDBA frame sent in the old band to
 establish a Block Ack in the new band shall include the Multi-band and the TCLAS elements. The resulting
 BA agreement, if established, applies to the band and channel identified in the Multi-band element included
 in the ADBBA frame. The BA is identified by the TID/TSID and MAC addresses of the Originator and the
 Recipient used in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element included in the ADDBA frames.
 The ADDBA Request frame may be issued in the old band and channel, and the corresponding ADDBA
 Response frame may be transmitted in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element within the
 ADDBA Request frame.
 The following rules for the multi-band BA establishment shall apply:
    1)    If the TA and/or the RA fields of the ADDBA Request frame are different from the Originator MAC
          address and/or the Recipient MAC address, respectively, used in the channel and band where the BA
          agreement should operate, then the Originator shall set the Source Address field and the Destination
          Address field of the classifier to the Originator MAC Address and the Recipient MAC address,
          respectively, to be used in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element included in the
          ADDBA Request frame.
    2)    If the TA and RA are equal to the Originator MAC address and the Recipient MAC address,
          respectively, then the Multi-band element, if any, included in the ADDBA Request frame shall
          indicate the band and channel over which the established BA is operating. The TCLAS element shall
          not be included in this ADDBA Request frame.
    3)    The Multi-band element should not be included in the ADDBA Request frame if in the case (2) the
          ADDBA Request frame is issued in the same band and channel over which the BA shall operate.
    4)    If the TA and/or the RA fields of the ADDBA Response frame are different from the Recipient
          MAC address and/or the Originator MAC address, respectively, to be used in the channel and band
          where the BA agreement should operate, then the Recipient shall set the Source Address field and
          the Destination Address field of the classifier to the Recipient MAC Address and the Originator
          MAC address, respectively, to be used in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element
          included in the ADDBA Response frame. The indicated band and channel shall be equal to the band
          and channel indicated in the Multi-band element of the ADDBA Request frame.
    5)    If the TA and RA fields are equal to the Recipient MAC address and the Originator MAC address,
          respectively, then the Multi-band element, if any, included in the ADDBA Response frame shall
          indicate the band and channel over which the established BA is operating. The indicated band and
          channel shall be equal to the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element of the ADDBA
          Request frame. The TCLAS element shall not be included in the ADDBA Response frame.

   6)    The Multi-band element should not be included in the ADDBA Response frame if in case 5) the
         ADDBA Response frame is issued in the same band and channel over which the BA, if established,
         shall operate.
10.32.3 FST teardown
At the Setup Completion state or Transition Done state, a STA may transmit an FST Tear Down frame to its
peer STA of the FST session in order to tear down an FST session that was previously set up using the FST
Setup Request/Response frame exchange. Upon transmission or reception of an FST Tear Down frame, the
initiator and responder move to the Initial state (10.32.2). When moving to the Initial state and if the value of
the Switch intent field in the last Session Transition element transmitted to a responder is 1, the initiator
behaves as described in 10.32.2.2.
10.32.4 On-channel Tunneling (OCT) operation
OCT allows a STA of a multi-band capable device to transmit an MMPDU that was constructed by a
different STA of the same device. An MMPDU transmitted this way is referred to as an OCT MMPDU. The
MLME of the nontransmitting STA that constructs or is the destination of an OCT MMPDU is referred to as
an NT-MLME. The MLME of the STA that transmits or receives an OCT MMPDU over the air is referred
to as a TR-MLME.
NOTE—OCT can be used in conjunction with or independent from the FST setup protocol.
Figure 10-35 depicts the overall OCT procedure. In this figure, <primitive> refers to the name of any of the
MLME primitives defined in 6.3 that meets all of the following conditions:
   —     Defines request, indication, response, and confirm primitives, or just request and indication
         primitives.
   —     Includes a peer Multi-band element. The peer Multi-band element is used to identify the peer NT-
         MLME.
   —     Includes a local Multi-band element. The local Multi-band element is used to identify the local NT-
         MLME.
An MLME primitive meeting all of the above conditions is referred to as an OCT MLME primitive.
NOTE—MLME-AUTHENTICATE, MLME-ASSOCIATE, and MLME-REASSOCIATE are examples of primitives
that are OCT MLME primitives.
To transmit a tunneled MMPDU, the SME of a multi-band capable device generates an OCT MLME request
primitive that includes the peer Multi-band element and the local Multi-band element.
A NT-MLME receiving an OCT MLME request primitive shall
   —     As defined in this standard, process the request and construct an OCT MMPDU corresponding to the
         primitive in question. The NT-MLME shall not transmit any frame as a result of this primitive.
   —     Generate an MLME-OCTunnel.request primitive with parameters including the OCT MMPDU and
         the peer Multi-band element. The MLME-OCTunnel.request primitive shall be generated to the TR-
         MLME identified by the local Multi-band element which is contained within the OCT MMPDU.
A TR-MLME receiving an MLME-OCTunnel.request primitive shall transmit an On-channel Tunnel
Request frame addressed to the peer TR-MLME and which includes the tunneled MMPDU.
A TR-MLME receiving an On-channel Tunnel Request frame shall generate an MLME-
OCTunnel.indication primitive. The MLME-OCTunnel.indication primitive shall be generated to the NT-
MLME identified by the peer Multi-band element contained within the received On-channel Tunnel Request
frame.

10.33 MMSL cluster operation
10.33.1 Introduction
A STA is MMSL cluster capable if it includes an MMS element in its most recent transmission of
(Re)Association Request, (Re)Association Response, ADDTS Request, ADDTS Response, Probe Request,
Probe Response, Information Request, or Information Response frames.
An MM-SME coordinated STA shall be MMSL cluster capable, except for an MM-SME that coordinates
two STAs where one STA is a member PCP/AP in a centralized PCP/AP cluster and the other STA is
associated to the S-AP of the centralized PCP/AP cluster.
NOTE—In the centralized clustering case, the two STAs in the MM-SME are communicating with different MAC
entities with different SMEs, so there is no individual link for MMSL.
A non-MM-SME coordinated STA may be MMSL cluster capable.
An MMSL cluster capable STA shall include an MMS element in transmitted (Re)Association Request and
(Re)Association Response frames.
As described in 4.9.3, an MM-SME may coordinate multiple MACs (and their respective STAs).
Each STA coordinated by the same MM-SME may be used for the MMSL cluster setup and maintenance.
The PCP may deliver an MMS element that includes a MAC address that is equal to the BSSID and other
MAC addresses that are not equal to the BSSID. The MAC addresses that are not the BSSID shall not be
used to request and respond to association, reassociation, probing, and scheduling services provided by the
PCP.
If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has delivered an MMS element to the PCP/AP, the non-PCP/non-AP STA shall
not send an ADDTS Request frame to the PCP/AP with the TA field equal to a MAC address that was not
included in the delivered MMS element.
If an MM-SME coordinated STA is associated with a PCP/AP that allocates one single AID to all STAs
advertised in the MMS element sent by the MM-SME coordinated STA, the AID can be also used to identify
the MMSL cluster. If the AID is provided for one of the advertised STAs of the MM-SME coordinated STA,
then the same AID applies to all STAs whose addresses are referenced in the delivered MMS element and
the Single AID field is set as per Table 8-183t.
Table 10-17 covers the possible cases of the AID use for MMSL cluster identification.

    associated to a BSS and one MAC entity of non-
    PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA B is
    associated to the same BSS.
 10.33.2 MMSL cluster setup
 10.33.2.1 General
 To establish an MMSL cluster, an MMS element of an MM-SME coordinated STA that lists its advertised
 STAs shall be delivered to the peer STA. The peer STA may be an MM-SME coordinated STA or a non-
 MM-SME coordinated STA. An MMSL cluster is identified by one of the following:
    a)    Advertised MAC addresses of the MAC entities of two MM-SME coordinated STAs
    b)    Advertised MAC addresses of the MAC entities of an MM-SME coordinated STA and of a non-
          MM-SME coordinated STA
 In both cases, the MMS element shall be exchanged between the STAs to set up the MMSL cluster
 agreement.
 If an MMSL cluster capable non-MM-SME coordinated STA receives an ADDTS Request frame that
 includes an MMS element, the SME of the non-MM-SME coordinated STA shall include the received MMS
 element in the MLME-ADDTS.response primitive used to send the ADDTS Response frame if the SME
 accepts the MMSL cluster setup. The SME of the non-MM-SME coordinated STA may set the MMS
 Element Owner field to “no Owner” in the MMS element included in an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request
 primitive and MLME-ADDTS.request primitive to establish the MMSL cluster with an MM-SME
 coordinated STA.
 The MMS element shall be exchanged between the STAs of the MMSL cluster only once per MMSL cluster
 setup.

10.33.2.2 MMSL cluster setup of non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA with PCP/AP
The Association Request and Response frames are used to establish an MMSL cluster between a non-PCP/
non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA and a PCP/AP. The MMS Control field within the MMS element
included in the Association Request and Response frame should be asserted as per 8.4.2.155. If the PCP/AP
is not an MM-SME coordinated STA, the PCP/AP shall include the MMS element received from the non-
PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA in the Association Response frame sent as response. If the PCP/
AP is an MM-SME coordinated STA, the PCP/AP should include its own MMS element that contains its
advertised MAC entities in the Association Response frame and shall not include the MMS element received
from the non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA in the Association Response frame. The PCP/AP
shall not respond with any MMS element if it is not MMSL cluster capable.
The setup of the MMSL cluster fails if the Association Response frame does not contain the MMS element.
10.33.2.3 MMSL cluster setup of non-PCP/non-AP STA with another non-PCP/non-AP STA
If a non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA associated with a PCP/AP has established an AID
identified MMSL cluster with the PCP/AP, the non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA shall not use a
MAC address that was not included in the MMS element delivered to the PCP/AP to establish an MMSL
cluster with another non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA associated with the same PCP/AP.
An ADDTS Request/Response frame exchange with a PTP TSPEC shall be used to establish the MMSL
cluster between non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STAs and between a non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME
coordinated STA and a non-PCP/non-AP non-MM-SME coordinated STA.
A non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA shall include an MMS element that contains its advertised
MAC entities in transmitted ADDTS Request frames. The MMS Control field within the transmitted MMS
element should be asserted as per 8.4.2.155. If the non-PCP/non-AP STA is not an MM-SME coordinated
STA, the non-PCP/non-AP STA should include the MMS element with the MMS Element Owner field set
to “no Owner” in the ADDTS Request frame.
The non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA shall include its own MMS element that contains its
advertised MAC entities in transmitted ADDTS Response frames. The MMS Control field within the
transmitted MMS element should be asserted as per 8.4.2.155. The non-MM-SME coordinated STA may
include the MMS element of the MM-SME coordinated STA from which it received an ADDTS Request
frame in the ADDTS Response sent as response. The non-MM-SME coordinated STA shall not respond
with any MMS element if it is not MMSL cluster capable.
The setup of the MMSL cluster fails if the ADDTS Response does not contain the MMS element.
10.34 DMG coexistence with non-IEEE-802.11 systems
This subclause describes the features available in this standard to improve coexistence with other DMG
systems, including IEEE Std 802.15.3cTM.
The same common channelization that is defined in other DMG standards and specifications is adopted
(21.3.1). In regulatory domains where 2 or more channels are defined, a DMG STA should support at least
2 channels.
An AP should not start an infrastructure BSS on a channel where the signal level is at or above
aDMGDetectionThres or upon detecting a valid IEEE 802.15.3c CMS preamble at a receive level equal to or
greater than –60 dBm.
Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.                                                            409
IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                             LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 If a DMG STA is capable of performing directional channel measurements (10.31) to detect non-
 IEEE-802.11 transmissions on a channel, it can report the results of the measurements to the DMG STA’s
 PCP/AP.
 If a DMG STA detects a non-IEEE-802.11 transmission on its channel or if the PCP/AP receives a report
 (10.11) from a DMG STA on a non-IEEE-802.11 transmission, the following mechanisms might be used to
 mitigate interference:
    —     Change operating channel (10.9)
    —     Beamforming (9.35)
    —     Reduce transmit power (10.8)
    —     Perform FST (10.32)
    —     Move the TBTT (10.30.2), and thus the beacon interval, in the case of an AP or PCP
    —     Change the schedule of SPs and CBAPs in the beacon interval (8.4.2.134) in the case of an AP or
          PCP
    —     Defer transmission for a later time
    —     For periods of time in the beacon interval where the DMG STA experiences poor channel quality,
          the DMG STA can use the TSCONST field within the DMG TSPEC element (8.4.2.136) to request
          its PCP/AP to avoid scheduling an SP for that DMG STA during those periods of time in the beacon
          interval.
 10.35 DMG relay procedures
 10.35.1 General
 Relaying allows a source relay endpoint DMG STA (REDS) to transmit frames to a destination REDS with
 the assistance of another DMG STA called the relay DMG STA (RDS). Relaying can improve the reliability
 of communication in a DMG BSS in case the direct link between the source REDS and the destination
 REDS is disrupted.
 A STA is a REDS if both dot11REDSActivated and dot11RelayActivated are true. A REDS shall set the
 Relay Usability field within its Relay Capabilities element to 1. A STA is an RDS if both
 dot11RDSActivated and dot11RelayActivated are true. An RDS shall set the Relay Supportability field
 within its Relay Capabilities element to 1. A STA is relay capable if dot11RelayActivated is true and it is
 either a REDS or an RDS or both, and it is relay incapable otherwise.
 A relay capable STA shall advertise its capability by including the Relay Capabilities element in
 (Re)Association Request, (Re)Association Response, Probe Request, Probe Response, Information Request,
 and Information Response frames. An AP or relay capable PCP may include the Relay Capabilities element
 in DMG Beacon frames.
 For a STA to operate as a REDS or an RDS in an Infrastructure BSS or PBSS, the following conditions shall
 be met:
    —     The STA is a member of the Infrastructure BSS or PBSS.
    —     The TDDTI field within the DMG STA Capabilities element of the PCP/AP of the BSS is 1.
    —     The Relay permission field within the Relay Capabilities element of the PCP/AP of the BSS is 1.
 After an RDS selection through the common relay setup procedures defined in 10.35.2 and prior to data
 frame transmission, a source REDS, a destination REDS and an RDS shall establish pair-wise authentication
 among these STAs if the dot11RSNAEnabled variable for any of these STAs is true.

                                                                                                        IEEE
ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                  Std 802.11ad-2012
A source REDS, a destination REDS and an RDS can establish the types of relay operation as specified in
9.39.
As needed, in the following subclauses, source REDS, RDS, and destination REDS are expressed as ‘S’,
‘R’, and ‘D’, respectively. Also, a direct link between STA S and STA D can be simply referred to as ‘S-D’
link.
10.35.2 Common relay setup procedures
10.35.2.1 Introduction
This subclause describes the procedures that a source REDS, a destination REDS, and an RDS employ to set
up a relay operation among these STAs. These procedures are used for both link switching and link
cooperating relays, and shall be performed in the order shown in this subclause.
10.35.2.2 Relay capabilities and RDS discovery procedures
A source REDS can obtain the capabilities of other STAs in the BSS following the STA’s association with
the BSS or with the transmission of an Information Request frame as described in 10.29.1.
A source DMG STA that intends to set up relay operation with a destination DMG STA shall obtain the
capabilities of the destination DMG STA prior to initiating the relay setup procedure with the destination
DMG STA. The source DMG STA may attempt to set up relay operation with the destination DMG STA
only if both the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA are REDS, and there exists at least one RDS
in the BSS.
Upon receiving an MLME-RELAYSearch.request primitive, the source DMG STA can discover a list of
RDSs in the BSS by transmitting a Relay Search Request frame to the PCP/AP with the destination REDS
AID field set to the AID of the destination DMG STA. The MLME of the PCP/AP receiving a Relay Search
Request frame shall generate an MLME-RELAYSearch.indication primitive. Upon receiving an MLME-
RELAYSearch.response primitive, the PCP/AP shall transmit a Relay Search Response frame addressed to
the requesting STA and shall include in the transmitted frame a list of RDSs in the BSS. The MLME of the
source DMG STA receiving a Relay Search Response frame shall generate an MLME-
RELAYSearch.confirm primitive. After the transmission of the Relay Search Response frame to the source
DMG STA, the PCP/AP shall transmit an unsolicited Relay Search Response frame to the destination DMG
STA with the Relay Capable STA Info field of the source DMG STA and the list of RDSs that the PCP/AP
included in the last Relay Search Response frame transmitted to the source DMG STA.
10.35.2.3 RDS selection procedure
Following the transmission of a Relay Search Response frame, the PCP/AP should schedule within its
Extended Schedule element two SPs for each RDS included in the transmitted Relay Search Response
frame:
   —     An SP having as source DMG STA the source REDS and as destination DMG STA the RDS, and
         with the Beamforming Training field set to 1. The duration of the SP should be such that the source
         REDS and RDS can complete BF as described in 9.35.
   —     An SP having as source DMG STA the RDS and as destination DMG STA the destination REDS,
         and with the Beamforming Training field set to 1. The duration of the SP should be such that the
         RDS and the destination REDS can complete BF as described in 9.35.
After the RDS completes BF with both the source REDS and destination REDS, the source REDS shall send
a Multi-Relay Channel Measurement Request frame to the RDS, which shall respond with the transmission
of a Multi-Relay Channel Measurement Report frame back to the source REDS. Following the reception of

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                              LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 this frame, the source REDS should perform BF with the destination REDS as described in 9.35, and once
 BF is completed the source REDS shall transmit a Multi-Relay Channel Measurement Request frame to the
 destination REDS. In response, the destination REDS shall transmit a Multi-Relay Channel Measurement
 Report frame to the source REDS including the channel measurement information between the destination
 REDS and all RDSs known to the destination REDS. To shorten the time it takes to complete this procedure,
 STAs can limit BF to the SLS phase only.
 Once this procedure is completed, the source REDS becomes aware of all the channel measurement
 information between the source REDS and zero or more RDSs and between the destination REDS and zero
 or more RDSs. The source REDS shall then select a single STA to operate as the RDS between the source
 REDS and the destination REDS. The selection of the RDS is implementation-dependent, and it can be
 based on information contained within an RDS’s Relay capability element and channel measurements.
 10.35.2.4 RLS procedure
 Following the selection of the RDS to be used between the source REDS and the destination REDS, the
 source REDS receiving an MLME-RLS.request primitive initiates the RLS procedure by sending an RLS
 Request frame to the selected RDS. The RLS Request frame includes the capabilities and the AIDs of the
 source REDS, the destination REDS, and the RDS, and the relay transfer parameter set. Upon receiving the
 RLS Request frame, the RDS shall transmit an RLS Request frame to the destination REDS containing the
 same information as received within the frame body of the source REDS’s RLS Request frame.
 The MLME of the destination REDS receiving a Relay Search Request frame shall generate an MLME-
 RLS.indication primitive. Upon receiving an MLME-RLS.response primitive, the destination REDS shall
 transmit an RLS Response frame to the RDS with the destination status code field set to SUCCESS if the
 destination REDS is willing to participate in the RLS, and set to 37 (“The request has been declined”) if the
 destination REDS is not willing to participate in the RLS. Upon receiving the RLS Response frame, the RDS
 shall transmit an RLS Response frame to the source REDS containing the same information as received
 within the destination REDS’s RLS Response frame, with the exception that the RDS shall set the relay
 status code field to SUCCESS if the RDS is willing to participate in the RLS, and shall set it to 37 (“The
 request has been declined”) if the RDS is not willing to participate in the RLS.
 The MLME of the source DMG STA receiving an RLS Response frame from the RDS shall generate an
 MLME-RLS.confirm primitive. Upon receiving an RLS Response frame with the destination status code
 and relay status code fields set to SUCCESS, the source DMG STA may transmit an RLS Announcement
 frame to the PCP/AP to indicate that the RLS procedure was successfully completed. If either or both of the
 destination status code and relay status code fields are nonzero, the RLS procedure is unsuccessful.
 Upon the completion of RLS procedure, the source REDS, the destination REDS, and the RDS can redo BF
 among them.
 10.35.3 Relay operation-type change procedure
 The source REDS may change the relay operation type from link switching to link cooperating, and vice-
 versa, if either one of S-D, or S-R, or R-D links becomes unavailable or for other reasons. Link
 unavailability can be determined by the source DMG STA not receiving expected frames from the
 destination REDS. To assist in this decision, the source REDS can use the link adaptation procedure (9.39.4)
 to obtain the quality of a link.
 To change the relay operation type within an SP from link cooperating to link switching in a case that the S-
 D link becomes unavailable, the source REDS shall transmit a ROC Request frame to the RDS with the link
 cooperating subfield set to 0 and the relay-link subfield set to 1. Upon receiving a ROC Request frame, the
 RDS shall transmit a ROC Request frame to the destination REDS containing the same information as
 received within the frame body of the source REDS’s ROC Request frame. Following the reception of a
 412                                                                     Copyright © 2012 IEEE. All rights reserved.
                                                                                                                IEEE
ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                           Std 802.11ad-2012
ROC Request frame, the destination REDS shall respond with a ROC Response frame to the RDS with the
status code field set to SUCCESS if the destination REDS accepts to change the operation into link
switching, and set to 37 (“The request has been declined”) if the destination REDS rejects the request. Upon
receiving the ROC Response frame, the RDS shall transmit a ROC Response to the source REDS with the
status code field set to SUCCESS only if the RDS accepts to change the operation into link switching and
the status code field set to SUCCESS in the ROC Response frame received from destination REDS.
Otherwise, the RDS shall set the status code field to 37 (“The request has been declined”). Upon reception of
a ROC Response from the RDS with the status code field set to SUCCESS, the source REDS immediately
starts to transmit frames to the destination REDS via the RDS relay link.
To change the relay operation type from link cooperating to link switching in other case that the S-R link
becomes unavailable, the source REDS shall a ROC Request frame to the destination REDS with the link
cooperating subfield set to 0 and the relay-link subfield set to 0. Following the reception of a ROC Request
frame, the destination REDS shall respond with a ROC Response frame to the source REDS with the status
code field indicating the acceptance or rejection of the request. Upon reception of a ROC Response from the
destination REDS with the status code field set to SUCCESS, the source REDS starts to transmit frames to
the destination REDS via the direct link in link switching mode.
To change the relay operation type within an SP from link switching to link cooperating, the source REDS
shall transmit a ROC Request frame to the destination REDS via the RDS with the link cooperating subfield
set to 1. Following the reception of a ROC Request frame from the RDS, the destination REDS shall respond
with a ROC Response frame to the source REDS via the RDS with the status code field indicating the
acceptance or rejection of the request. Upon reception of a ROC Response frame from the RDS with the
status code field set to SUCCESS, the source REDS immediately starts to transmit frames to the destination
REDS using the RDS in link cooperating mode. If a TPA procedure was not performed beforehand since the
link switching operation has been continued from the start of relay operation, the STA shall perform the
TPA procedure before transmitting using link cooperating mode.
NOTE—As described in 9.39.3.2.3, during the SP in link cooperating operation the destination REDS has its receive
antenna pattern such that it simultaneously covers the links towards both the source REDS and the RDS.
10.35.4 Relay teardown
A source REDS that has successfully completed the RLS procedure with a destination REDS may teardown
the relay operation between the source REDS, destination REDS and RDS. To do that, the source REDS
shall transmit an RLS Teardown frame to the RDS, destination REDS and PCP/AP of the BSS. Within the
RLS Teardown frame, the source REDS shall set the source AID field to the AID of the source REDS, the
destination AID field to the AID of the destination REDS and the relay AID field to the AID of the RDS.
A RDS may teardown the relay operation between the source REDS, destination REDS and RDS. To do
that, the RDS shall transmit an RLS Teardown frame to the source REDS, destination REDS and PCP/AP of
the BSS. Within the RLS Teardown frame, the RDS shall set the source AID field to the AID of the source
REDS, the destination AID field to the AID of the destination REDS and the relay AID field to the AID of
the RDS.

10.36.1 General
An AP that supports QAB shall set the QAB Capability field within the AP’s Extended Capabilities element
to 1 and shall set the QAB Capability field to 0 otherwise. In addition, if an AP supports QAB, the AP shall
also support scheduling SPs as defined in 9.33.6.

 10.36.2 Procedure at the requester AP
 Upon receipt of an MLME-QAB.request primitive, an AP shall perform the following procedure to start the
 Quiet Adjacent BSS operation (Figure 10-36):
    a)   If both the requester and responder APs are QAB capable as indicated by the QAB Capability field
         within the Extended Capabilities element, the requester AP sends a QAB Request frame indicating
         the duration, period, offset, and number of the quiet intervals. The requester AP may include
         multiple Quiet Period Request elements in one frame targeting multiple responder APs.
    b)   If a QAB Response frame is received with the matching dialog token and request token with a status
         code set to a value of SUCCESS, the AP has confirmed the responder AP has scheduled the
         requested quiet periods, and the MLME shall issue an MLME-QAB.confirm primitive indicating the
         success of the procedure.
    c)   If a QAB Response frame is received with the matching dialog and request token with a status code
         set to a value other than SUCCESS, the procedure is considered to have failed, and the MLME shall
         issue an MLME-QAB.confirm primitive indicating the failure of the procedure.
    d)   If there is no response from the recipient within dot11QABTimeout, the MLME shall issue an
         MLME-QAB.confirm primitive indicating the failure of the procedure with a result code of
         TIMEOUT.
 NOTE—The GAS protocol can be used by an AP to verify the capabilities of another AP.
 10.36.3 Procedure at the responder AP
 A responder AP shall operate as follows (Figure 10-36):
    a)   When a QAB.Request frame matching the BSSID is received from another AP, the MLME shall
         issue an MLME-QAB.indication primitive.
    b)   Upon receipt of the MLME-QAB.response primitive, the AP shall respond by transmitting a QAB
         Response frame.
         1)    If the result code is SUCCESS, the request is accepted. The AP shall use SPs to schedule the
               quiet period(s) according to the accepted request. The SPs shall have the AP as both source and
               destination and the AP shall not transmit during the SP. The QAB procedure shall be
               terminated if the number of quiet intervals exceeds the value of the Repetition Count field
               specified. Contained in the transmitted QAB Response frame is the copy of the request token
               and the BSSID of the AP.
         2)    If the result code is REJECTED, the request has not been fulfilled.
 10.37 DMG beamforming
 Upon receipt of an MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive, a STA shall undertake beamforming training
 with the STA indicated by the PeerSTAAddress parameter according to the procedures defined in 9.35. This
 training shall start with the SLS and shall include the BRP if and only if the RequestBRP parameter of the
 MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive is true.
 A STA receiving MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive may act as either initiator or responder in the
 beamforming training.
 If the STA indicated by the PeerSTAAddress parameter of a received MLME-BF-TRAINING.request
 primitive is a PCP or AP of a BSS in which a STA is a member, the STA receiving the MLME-BF-
 TRAINING.request primitive may perform beamforming training during the A-BFT as described in 9.35.5.
 Alternatively, the STA receiving the MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive may use an SP or a TXOP to
 perform ISS as described in 9.35.2.2.

A STA receiving the MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive shall issue an MLME-BF-
TRAINING.confirm primitive on completion of the requested beamforming training or on timeout as
specified in 9.35.
A STA that performs beamforming training with a peer STA at the request of the peer STA shall issue a
MLME-BF-TRAINING.indication primitive on completion of that beamforming training, or on timeout as
specified in 9.35.
Figure 10-37 illustrates an example of the beamforming training procedure in the DTI for a case where the
STA receiving the MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive acts as initiator.
Figure 10-38 illustrates an example of the beamforming training procedure in the context of a non-PCP/non-
AP STA joining an infrastructure BSS or PBSS. In this scenario, the MLME-BF-TRAINING.request
primitive is issued by the STA attempting to associate in order that the link be trained to a degree that allows
the over-the-air exchanges necessary for association to succeed.

11. Security
11.1 Framework
11.1.2 Security methods
Change the second paragraph of 11.1.2 as follows:
RSNA security comprises the following algorithms:
   —    TKIP, described in 11.4.2
   —    CCMP, described in 11.4.3
   —    BIP, described in 11.4.4
   —    GCMP, described in 11.4.5
   —    RSNA establishment and termination procedures, including use of IEEE 802.1X authentication,
        described in 11.5 and SAE authentication described in 11.3
   —    Key management procedures, described in 11.6
11.1.3 RSNA equipment and RSNA capabilities
Change the first paragraph of 11.1.3 as follows:
RSNA-capable equipment can create RSNAs. When dot11RSNAEnabled is true, RSNA-capable equipment
shall include the RSNE in Beacon, Probe Response, Information Response, and (Re)Association Request
frames and in Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way Handshake; shall set the DMG Privacy subfield to 1
within transmitted DMG Beacons; and may include the RSNE in DMG Beacon and Announce frames. Pre-
RSNA equipment is not capable of creating RSNAs.
11.1.4 RSNA establishment
Change the first paragraph of 11.1.4 as follows:
An SME establishes an RSNA in one of four six ways:
   a)   If an RSNA is based on IEEE 802.1X AKM in an ESS, an RSNA-capable STA’s SME establishes
        an RSNA as follows:
        1)    It identifies the AP as RSNA-capable from the AP’s Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce,
              Information Response, or Probe Response frames.
        2)    It shall invoke Open System authentication if the STA is a non-DMG STA.
Items a) 3) to 7) remain unchanged.
   b)   If an RSNA is based on a PSK or password in an ESS, the SME establishes an RSNA as follows:
        1)    It identifies the AP as RSNA-capable from the AP’s Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce,
              Information Response, or Probe Response frames.
        2)    If the RSNA-capable AP advertises support for SAE authentication in its Beacon or Probe
              Response frames, and the STA has a group defined in the dot11RSNAConfigDLCGroupTable
              and a password for the AP in the dot11RSNAConfigPasswordValueTable, the STA shall
              invoke SAE authentication to establish a PMK. If the RSNA-capable AP does not advertise
              support for SAE authentication in its Beacon and Probe Response frames but advertises support
              for the alternate form of PSK authentication (see 4.10.3.4), and the STA also supports the
              alternate form of PSK authentication, the non-DMG STA may invoke Open System

               below.
 Items b) 3) to 6) remain unchanged.
    c)   If an RSNA is based on a PSK or password in an IBSS, the SME executes the following sequence of
         procedures:
         1)    It identifies the peer as RSNA-capable from the peer’s Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce,
               Information Response, or Probe Response frames.
               NOTE—STAs might respond to a data MPDU from an unrecognized STA by sending a Probe Request
               frame to find out whether the unrecognized STA is RSNA-capable.
         2)    If the RSNA-capable peer advertises support for SAE authentication in its Beacon and Probe
               Response frames and the STA has a group defined in the dot11RSNAConfigDLCGroupTable
               and a password for the peer in the dot11RSNAConfigPasswordValueTable, the STA shall
               invoke SAE authentication and establish a PMK. If the RSNA-capable peer does not advertise
               support for SAE authentication but advertises support for the alternate form of PSK
               authentication (see 4.10.3.4) and the STA also supports the alternate form of PSK
               authentication, the STA may optionally invoke Open System authentication if the STA is a
               non-DMG STA and use a PSK as the PMK with the alternate form of PSK authentication.
 Items c) 3) and 4) remain unchanged.
    d)   If an RSNA is based on IEEE 802.1X AKM in an IBSS, an RSNA-capable STA’s SME establishes
         an RSNA as follows:
         1)    It identifies the peer as RSNA-capable from the peer’s Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce,
               Information Response, or Probe Response frames.
               NOTE—STAs might respond to a data MPDU from an unrecognized STA by sending a Probe Request
               frame to find out whether the unrecognized STA is RSNA-capable.
         2)    It may optionally invoke Open System authentication if the STA is a non-DMG STA.
 Items d) 3) to 5) remain unchanged.
    e)   In order to associate with a PCP in a PBSS, an RSNA-capable STA’s SME establishes an RSNA
         with the PCP following the RSNA establishment steps in an ESS in accordance with method a) and
         b) above, as appropriate, with the PCP taking the role of the AP.
    f)   When an RSNA-capable STA chooses not to associate with a peer in a PBSS, its SME establishes an
         RSNA with the peer following the RSNA establishment steps in an IBSS in accordance with method
         c) or d) above, as appropriate, with the caveat that the RSNA authentication and key management
         algorithm is executed only once between the peers.

11.4 RSNA confidentiality and integrity protocols
11.4.1 Overview
Change the first paragraph of 11.4.1 as follows:
This standard defines two three RSNA data confidentiality and integrity protocols: TKIP, and CCMP, and
GCMP. DMG STAs claiming RSNA compliance shall support GCMP. This standard defines one integrity
protocol for management frames: BIP.

11.4.3.1 General
Change the first paragraph of 11.4.3.1 as follows:
Subclause 11.4.3 specifies the CCMP, which provides data confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and
replay protection. In a non-DMG network, CCMP is mandatory for RSN compliance.
11.4.3.3 CCMP cryptographic encapsulation

Change item g) in the lettered list of the third paragraph of 11.4.3.3.3 as follows:
  g)    QC – QoS Control field, if present, a 2-octet field that includes the MSDU priority. The QC TID is
        used in the construction of the AAD. When in a non-DMG BSS and both the STA and its peer have
        their SPP A-MSDU Capable fields equal to 1, bit 7 (the A-MSDU Present field) is used in the
        construction of the AAD. The remaining QC fields are masked to 0 for the AAD calculation (bits 4
        to 6, bits 8 to 15, and bit 7 when either the STA or its peer has the SPP A-MSDU Capable field equal
        to 0). When in a DMG BSS, the A-MSDU Present bit 7 and A-MSDU Type bit 8 are used in the
        construction of the AAD, and the remaining QC fields are masked to 0 for the AAD calculation (bits
        4 to 6, bits 9 to 15).

11.4.5 GCM with Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) Protocol (GCMP)
11.4.5.1 GCMP overview
Subclause 11.4.5 specifies the GCMP, which provides data confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and
replay protection.
GCMP is based on the GCM of the AES encryption algorithm. GCM combines Galois/Counter Mode for
data confidentiality and GMAC for authentication and integrity. GCM protects the integrity of both the
MPDU Data field and selected portions of the MPDU header.
The AES algorithm is defined in FIPS PUB 197-2001. All AES processing used within GCMP uses AES
with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size.

Std 802.11ad-2012                                LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 GCM is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-38D. GCM is a generic mode that can be used with any
 block-oriented encryption algorithm.
 GCM requires a fresh temporal key for every session. GCM also requires a unique nonce value for each
 frame protected by a given temporal key, and GCMP uses a 96-bit nonce that includes a 48-bit packet
 number (PN) for this purpose. Reuse of a PN with the same temporal key voids all security guarantees.
 GCMP uses a 128-bit MIC.
 Annex M provides test vectors for GCM.
 When GCMP is selected as the RSN pairwise cipher and management frame protection is negotiated,
 individually addressed robust management frames shall be protected with GCMP.
 11.4.5.2 GCMP MPDU format
 Figure 11-23a shows the MPDU format when using GCMP.
                                                                  Encrypted

 GCMP processing expands the original MPDU size by 24 octets, 8 octets for the GCMP Header field and 16
 octets for the MIC field. The GCMP Header field is constructed from the PN and Key ID subfields. The 48-
 bit PN is represented as an array of 6 octets. PN5 is the most significant octet of the PN, and PN0 is the least
 significant.
 The ExtIV subfield (bit 5) of the Key ID octet is always set to 1 for GCMP.
 Bits 6–7 of the Key ID octet are for the Key ID subfield. The remaining bits of the Key ID octet are reserved.

GCMP encrypts the payload of a plaintext MPDU and encapsulates the resulting cipher text using the
following steps:
   a)     Increment the PN, to obtain a fresh PN for each MPDU, so that the PN never repeats for the same
          temporal key.
          NOTE—Retransmitted MPDUs are not modified on retransmission.
   b)     Use the fields in the MPDU header to construct the additional authentication data (AAD) for GCM.
          The GCM algorithm provides integrity protection for the fields included in the AAD. MPDU header
          fields that may change when retransmitted are masked to 0 when calculating the AAD.
   c)     Construct the GCM Nonce block from the PN and A2, where A2 is MPDU Address 2.
   d)     Place the new PN and the key identifier into the 8-octet GCMP Header.
   e)     Use the temporal key, AAD, nonce, and MPDU data to form the cipher text and MIC. This step is
          known as GCM originator processing.
   f)     Form the encrypted MPDU by combining the original MPDU header, the GCMP header, the
          encrypted data and MIC, as described in 11.4.5.2.
The GCM reference describes the processing of the key, nonce, AAD, and data to produce the encrypted
output. See 11.4.5.3.2 to 11.4.5.3.6 for details of the creation of the AAD and nonce from the MPDU and the
associated MPDU-specific processing.
11.4.5.3.2 PN processing
Each transmitter shall maintain a single PN (48-bit counter) for each PTKSA, GTKSA, and STKSA.
The PN shall be implemented as a 48-bit monotonically incrementing non-negative integer, initialized to 1
when the corresponding temporal key is initialized or refreshed.
The PN is incremented by a positive number for each MPDU. The PN shall never repeat for a series of
encrypted MPDUs using the same temporal key.
If the PN is larger than the value of dot11PNExhaustionThreshold, an MLME-PN-Exhaustion.indication
primitive shall be generated.

The AAD construction is as defined in 11.4.3.3.3.

 11.4.5.3.6 GCM originator processing
 GCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode, and in this standard, GCM is used with the
 AES block cipher.
 There are four inputs to GCM originator processing:
    a)   Key: the temporal key (16 octets).
    b)   Nonce: the nonce (12 octets) constructed as described in 11.4.5.3.4.
    c)   Frame body: the frame body of the MPDU.
    d)   AAD: the AAD (22-30 octets) constructed from the MPDU header as described in 11.4.5.3.3.
 The GCM originator processing provides authentication and integrity of the frame body and the AAD as
 well as data confidentiality of the frame body. The output from the GCM originator processing consists of
 the encrypted data and 16 additional octets of encrypted MIC.
 A GCMP protected individually addressed robust management frame shall be protected with the TK.

                         Figure 11-23d—GCMP decapsulation block diagram
GCMP decrypts the payload of a cipher text MPDU and decapsulates a plaintext MPDU using the following
steps:
   a)    The encrypted MPDU is parsed to construct the AAD and nonce values.
   b)    The AAD is formed from the MPDU header of the encrypted MPDU.
   c)    The Nonce value is constructed from the A2 and PN fields.
   d)    The MIC is extracted for use in the GCM integrity checking.
   e)    The GCM recipient processing uses the temporal key, AAD, nonce, MIC, and MPDU cipher text
         data to recover the MPDU plaintext data as well as to check the integrity of the AAD and MPDU
         plaintext data.
   f)    The received MPDU header and the MPDU plaintext data from the GCM recipient processing may
         be concatenated to form a plaintext MPDU.
   g)    The decryption processing prevents replay of MPDUs by validating that the PN in the MPDU is
         greater than the replay counter maintained for the session.
See 11.4.5.4.2 through 11.4.5.4.4 for details of this processing.
When the received frame is a GCMP protected individually addressed robust management frame, the
contents of the MMPDU body after protection is removed and shall be delivered to the MLME rather than
through the MA-UNITDATA.indication primitive.
11.4.5.4.2 GCM recipient processing
GCM recipient processing shall use the same parameters as GCM originator processing. A GCMP protected
individually addressed robust management frame shall use the same TK as a Data MPDU.
There are four inputs to GCM recipient processing:
   —     Key: the temporal key (16 octets).
   —     Nonce: the nonce (12 octets) constructed as described in 11.4.5.3.4.
   —     Encrypted frame body: the encrypted frame body from the received MPDU. The encrypted frame
         body includes a 16-octet MIC.
   —     AAD: the AAD (22-30 octets) that is the canonical MPDU header as described in 11.4.5.3.3.
The GCM recipient processing checks the authentication and integrity of the frame body and the AAD as
well as decrypting the frame body. The plaintext is returned only if the MIC check is successful.

 There is one output from error-free GCM recipient processing:
   —     Frame body: the plaintext frame body, which is 16 octets smaller than the encrypted frame body.
 11.4.5.4.3 Decrypted GCMP MPDU
 The decapsulation process succeeds when the calculated MIC matches the MIC value obtained from
 decrypting the received encrypted MPDU. The original MPDU header is concatenated with the plaintext
 data resulting from the successful GCM recipient processing to create the plaintext MPDU.
 11.4.5.4.4 PN and replay detection
 To effect replay detection, the receiver extracts the PN from the GCMP header. See 11.4.5.2 for a
 description of how the PN is encoded in the GCMP header. The following processing rules are used to detect
 replay:
   a)    The PN values sequentially number each MPDU.
   b)    A receiver shall maintain a separate set of PN replay counters for each PTKSA, GTKSA, and
         STKSA. The receiver initializes these replay counters to 0 when it resets the temporal key for a peer.
         The replay counter is set to the PN value of accepted GCMP MPDUs.
   c)    For each PTKSA, GTKSA, and STKSA, the recipient shall maintain a separate replay counter for
         each possible IEEE 802.11 MSDU or A-MSDU priority (including, for example, each possible TID)
         and shall use the PN recovered from a received frame to detect replayed frames. A replayed frame
         occurs when the PN extracted from a received frame is less than or equal to the current replay
         counter value for the frame’s MSDU or A-MSDU priority (including, for example, each possible
         TID) and frame type.
         For each IGTKSA the recipient shall maintain a single replay counter for protected group addressed
         robust management frames, and shall compare the IPN recovered from a received, protected group
         addressed robust management frame to the replay counter to detect replayed frames as described
         above for data frames.
         If dot11RSNAProtectedManagementFramesActivated is true, the recipient shall maintain a single
         replay counter for received individually addressed robust management frames within the context of
         each Protected Management frame pairing and shall use the PN from the received frame to detect
         replays. A replayed frame occurs when the PN from the frame is less than or equal to the current
         management frame replay counter value corresponding to the TA of the received management
         frame. The transmitter shall preserve the order of protected robust management frames sent to the
         same DA.
   d)    A receiver shall discard any data MPDU that is received with its PN less than or equal to the value of
         the replay counter that is associated with the TA and priority of the received MPDU. If
         dot11RSNAProtectedManagementFramesActivated is true, a receiver shall discard any group
         addressed MMPDU that is received with its PN less than or equal to the value of the replay counter
         associated with group addressed MMPDUs. If dot11RSNAProtectedManagementFramesActivated
         is true, the receiver shall discard any individually addressed robust MMPDU that is received with its
         PN less than or equal to the value of the replay counter associated with the TA of that individually
         addressed MMPDU. When discarding a frame, the receiver shall increment by 1 the value of
         dot11RSNAStatsGCMPReplays for data frames or dot11RSNAStatsRobustMgmtGCMPReplays
         for robust management frames.
   e)    For MSDUs or A-MSDUs sent using the Block Ack feature, reordering of received MSDUs or A-

11.5 RSNA security association management
11.5.1 Security associations
11.5.1.1 Security association definitions
11.5.1.1.2 PMKSA
Change the second list item in the dashed list of the first paragraph of 11.5.1.1.2 as indicated:
  —     Authenticator’s or peer’s MAC address. For multi-band RSNA, the MAC address is associated with
        the operating band in use when the PMKSA is established.
11.5.1.1.6 PTKSA
Change the first paragraph in 11.5.1.1.6 as follows:
The PTKSA is a result of the 4-Way Handshake, FT 4-Way Handshake, FT Protocol, or FT Resource
Request Protocol. This security association is also bidirectional. PTKSAs are cached for the life of the
PMKSA or PMK-R1 security association. Because the PTKSA is tied to the PMKSA or to a PMK-R1
security association, it only has the additional information from the 4-Way Handshake. For the PTKSA
derived as a result of the 4-Way Handshake, there shall be only one PTKSA per band (see 11.5.19) with the
same Supplicant and Authenticator MAC addresses. For the PTKSA derived as a result of an initial mobility
domain association or fast BSS transition, there shall be only one PTKSA with the same STA’s MAC
address and BSSID.
11.5.1.3 Security association life cycle
11.5.1.3.1 General
Change 11.5.1.3.1 as indicated:
A STA can operate in either an ESS, a PBSS, or in an IBSS, and a security association has a distinct life
cycle for each.
Insert the following subclause, 11.5.1.3.5, after 11.5.1.3.4:
11.5.1.3.5 Security association in a PBSS
A STA and a peer establish an initial security association via the following steps:
  a)    The STA selects an authorized PBSS by identifying a peer from a DMG Beacon, Announce, Probe
        Response, or Information Response frames.
  b)    A STA may associate with a peer if the peer is a PCP.
  c)    If authentication is required, the STA or the peer initiates IEEE 802.1X authentication. The EAP
        method used by IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 shall support mutual authentication.
  d)    The last step is key management. The authentication process creates cryptographic keys shared
        between the IEEE 802.1X AS and the STA. The AS transfers these keys to the peer and the peer and
        the STA use one of the key confirmation handshakes, e.g., the 4-Way Handshake or FT 4-Way
        Handshake, to complete security association establishment. The key confirmation handshake
        indicates when the link has been secured by the keys and is ready to allow data traffic and protected
        robust management frames.

 11.5.2 RSNA selection
 Change the first three paragraphs of 11.5.2 as follows:
 A STA prepared to establish RSNAs shall advertise its capabilities by including the RSNE in Beacon,
 Information Response, and Probe Response messages and may also include the RSNE in DMG Beacon and
 Announce frames. The included RSNE shall specify all the authentication and cipher suites enabled by the
 STA’s policy. A STA shall not advertise any authentication or cipher suite that is not enabled.
 The SME shall utilize the MLME-SCAN.request primitive to identify neighboring STAs that assert robust
 security and advertise an SSID identifying an authorized ESS, PBSS, or IBSS. A STA may decline to
 communicate with STAs that fail to advertise an RSNE in their Beacon, Information Response, and Probe
 Response frames or that do not advertise an authorized SSID. A STA may also decline to communicate with
 other STAs that do not advertise authorized authentication and cipher suites within their RSNEs.
 A STA shall advertise the same RSNE in both its Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, Information Response,
 and Probe Response frames.
 Insert the following subclause, 11.5.7a, after 11.5.7:
 11.5.7a RSNA policy selection in a PBSS
 RSNA policy selection in a PBSS utilizes the association procedure (10.3.1) if the initiating STA chooses to
 associate with a PCP. RSNA policy selection is performed by the associating STA. The STA does this by
 including an RSNE in its (Re)Association Requests.
 The STA follows the procedures in 11.4.3 to select RSNA policy with the PCP, with the PCP taking the role
 of the AP. If the initiating STA chooses not to associate with a peer in a PBSS, it follows the procedures in
 11.4.5 to select RSNA policy with the peer.
 11.5.8 RSNA management of the IEEE 802.1X Controlled Port
 Change the second and third paragraphs of 11.5.8, and insert a new fifth paragraph as indicated below:
 In an ESS/PBSS, if the STA associates with the PCP/AP, the STA indicates the IEEE 802.11 link is
 available by invoking the MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm or MLME-REASSOCIATE.confirm primitive.
 This signals the Supplicant that the MAC has transitioned from the disabled to enabled state. At this point,
 the Supplicant’s Controlled Port is blocked, and communication of all non-IEEE-802.1X MSDUs sent or
 received via the port is not authorized.
 In an ESS/PBSS, if the PCP/AP associates with a STA, the PCP/AP indicates that the IEEE 802.11 link is
 available by invoking the MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication or MLME-REASSOCIATE.indication primitive.
 At this point the Authenticator’s Controlled Port corresponding to the STA’s association is blocked, and
 communication of all non-IEEE-802.1X MSDUs sent or received via the Controlled Port is not authorized.
 In an IBSS, the STA shall block all IEEE 802.1X ports at initialization. Communication of all non-IEEE-
 802.1X MSDUs sent or received via the Controlled Port is not authorized.
 In a PBSS, if a STA chooses not to associate with the PCP, the STA shall block all IEEE 802.1X ports at
 initialization. Communication of all non-IEEE-802.1X MSDUs sent or received via the Controlled Port is
 not authorized.

Insert the following subclause, 11.5.11a, after 11.5.11:
11.5.11a RSNA authentication in a PBSS
IEEE 802.11 Open System authentication is not used in a PBSS.
When establishing an RSNA with a PCP, a STA may associate to the PCP and initiate RSNA authentication
with the PCP following the procedures of 11.4.8, with the PCP taking the role of the AP. When a STA
chooses not to associate to a peer, it initiates RSNA authentication with the peer following the procedures of
11.4.9 with the following caveat: if both peers simultaneously initiate RSNA authentication, the peer with
the lower MAC address shall abandon the authentication it initiated in favor of the authentication initiated
by the peer with the higher MAC address.
Insert the following subclause, 11.5.14a, after 11.5.14:
11.5.14a RSNA key management in a PBSS
Upon successful association and authentication in a PBSS, a STA performs a key confirmation handshake
with the PCP, following the procedures in 11.4.10 with the PCP taking the role of the AP. If a STA chooses
not to associate to a peer, after successful authentication, it performs a key confirmation handshake with the
peer following the procedures in 11.4.11 with the following caveat: if both peers simultaneously initiate the
key confirmation handshake, the peer with the lower MAC address shall abandon the handshake it initiated
in favor of the handshake initiated by the peer with the higher MAC address.
11.5.15 RSNA security association termination
Insert the following paragraphs at the end of 11.5.15:
When an STA’s SME receives an MLME-PN-Exhaustion.indication primitive and the PN is associated with
a PTKSA, the STA’s SME shall invoke an MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive and delete the
PTKSA.
When a STA’s SME receives an MLME-PN-Exhaustion.indication primitive and the PN is associated with a
GTKSA, the STA’s SME shall delete the GTKSA.
When a STA’s SME receives an MLME-PN-Exhaustion.indication primitive and the PN is associated with a
STKSA, the STA’s SME shall invoke a STSL application teardown procedure for the STKSA and delete the
STKSA.
Once the security associations have been deleted, the SME then invokes MLME-DELETEKEYS.request
primitive to delete all temporal keys associated with the deleted security associations.
Insert the following subclauses, 11.5.18 to 11.5.19.4, after 11.5.17:
11.5.18 RSNA rekeying
When a PTKSA is deleted, a non-PCP/non-AP STA may reassociate with the same PCP/AP and/or establish
a new RSNA with the PCP/AP. If the non-PCP/non-AP STA has cached one or more PMKSAs, it may skip
the PMKSA establishment and proceed with the creation of a new PTKSA by using 4-Way Handshake.
When a GTKSA is deleted, an originating STA may create a new GTKSA by using 4-Way Handshake or
Group Key Handshake.

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                               LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 When a STKSA is deleted, the STA_I may establish a new STSL with the STA_P. If the SMK between the
 STA pair has not expired, the STA_I may initiate a 4-Way Handshake and create a new STKSA with
 STA_P. If the SMK has expired, the STA_I shall create both a new SMKSA and a new STKSA with the
 STA_P.
 An Authenticator/STA_I may initiate a 4-Way Handshake for the purpose of renewing the key associated
 with a PTKSA or STKSA. A supplicant/STA_P may send an EAPOL request message to the authenticator/
 STA_I to request rekeying. In addition, if both the Authenticator and the Supplicant support multiple keys
 for individually addressed traffic, a smooth switchover to the new key is possible using the following
 procedure.
 The 802.11 MAC shall issue an MLME-PN-Warning.indication primitive when the Packet Number
 assignment for a particular PTKSA, GTKSA, or STKSA reaches or exceeds dot11PNWarningThreshold for
 the first time. The indication shall be issued only once for a given PTKSA, GTKSA, or STKSA. The SME
 may use the indication as a trigger to establish a new PTKSA, GTKSA, or STKSA before the Packet
 Number space is exhausted.
 A PTKSA or STKSA has a limited lifetime, either in absolute time or due to exhausting the PN space. To
 maintain an uninterrupted security association, a STA should establish a new PTKSA or STKSA prior to the
 expiry of the old PTKSA or STKSA.
 When both ends of the link support the expanded Key ID space for individually addressed traffic, it is
 possible to install the new PTKSA or STKSA without data loss, provided the new PTKSA or STKSA uses a
 different Key ID from the old PTKSA or STKSA. Data loss might occur if the same Key ID is used because
 it is not possible to precisely coordinate (due to software processing delays) when the new key is used for
 transmit at one end and when it is applied to receive at the other end. If a different Key ID is used for the
 new PTKSA or STKSA, then provided the new key is installed at the receive side prior to its first use at the
 transmit side there is no need for precise coordination. During the transition, received packets are
 unambiguously identified using the Key ID as belonging to either the old or new PTKSA or STKSA.
 11.5.19 Multi-band RSNA
 11.5.19.1 General
 A STA is multi-band capable and RSNA-capable if the values of both its local MIB variables
 dot11MultibandImplemented and dot11RSNAEnabled are true.
 A STA that is multi-band capable and RSNA-capable shall set the Pairwise Cipher Suite Present field of the
 Multi-band element to 1 and shall include the Pairwise Cipher Suite Count field and the Pairwise Cipher
 Suite List field in the Multi-band element. The STA may include the RSNE and the Multi-band element in
 the DMG Beacon and Announce frames and shall include the RSNE and the Multi-band element in Beacon,
 Probe Response, and Information Response frames. The included RSNE shall specify all the authentication
 and cipher suites enabled by the STA’s policy for the band where this element is transmitted, and the
 included Multi-band element shall specify all the pairwise cipher suites enabled by the STA’s policy for the
 band specified within the Multi-band element. A STA shall not advertise any cipher suite that is not enabled.
 A multi-band capable and RSNA-capable STA shall include the Multi-band element in the (Re)Association
 Request frame and in Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way Handshake.
 In order to set up an RSNA with a peer STA for a supported band/channel, a STA that does not know the
 peer’s policy for the band/channel shall first obtain the peer STA’s policy for the supported band/channel by
 using a Probe Request frame or Information Request frame. The STA initiating RSNA establishment for a
 supported band/channel is called RSNA initiator, and the targeted STA of the RSNA establishment is called
 RSNA responder.

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHPUT IN THE 60 GHz BAND                                     Std 802.11ad-2012
A multi-band capable device can create its own group key(s) for one or more supported bands/channels. If
the STA uses different MAC addresses in different bands/channels, different GTKSAs shall be created for
different bands. If the STA uses a same MAC address in all supported bands/channels, a single GTKSA
shall be created for all supported bands/channels.
If the pairwise and group cipher suites used by a pair of multi-band capable devices to communicate with
each other in the current operating band/channel is also supported after the transfer to another band/channel
that was performed using transparent FST, the devices shall continue using the same cipher suites to
communicate with each other after the transfer. In all other cases, a separate RSNA has to be established for
the other band/channel (see 11.5.19).
11.5.19.2 Nontransparent multi-band RSNA
An RSNA initiator can establish a nontransparent (10.32) multi-band RSNA with an RSNA responder for a
supported band/channel other than the current operating band/channel. The two STAs use the same PMKSA
for both the supported band/channel and the current operating band/channel and create different PTKSAs for
different bands/channels.
If the RSNA initiator does not have an existing PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the RSNA initiator shall
first establish a PMKSA with the RSNA responder in the current operating band/channel and then use the
PMKSA to create a PTKSA with the RSNA responder for the supported band/channel. If the RSNA initiator
has already established a PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the PMKSA shall be used to create a PTKSA
between the two STAs for the supported band/channel.
With the PMK in place, the RSNA initiator and RSNA responder can proceed in two ways depending on the
setting of the Joint Multi-band RSNA subfield within the RSN Capabilities field in the RSNE of both STAs.
If the Joint Multi-band RSNA subfield within the RSN Capabilities field of either the RSNA initiator or
RSNA responder is 0, the STA pair uses a 4-Way Handshake to establish a PTKSA for the current band/
channel and may start a separate 4-Way Handshake in the current operating band/channel to negotiate a
pairwise cipher suite for the supported band/channel and establish a PTKSA for the supported band/channel.
As specified in 11.6.6, Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way Handshake convey the Multi-band element
associated with the supported band/channel. The Multi-band element in Message 2 includes the selected
pairwise cipher suite for the supported band/channel. Message 3 includes the Multi-band element that the
STA would send in a Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, Probe Response, or Information Response frame.
Message 3 may optionally include a second Multi-band element that indicates the STA’s pairwise cipher
suite assignment for the supported band/channel.
If the Joint Multi-band RSNA subfield within the RSN Capabilities field is 1 for both the RSNA initiator and
the RSNA responder and at least one of the STAs uses different MAC addresses for different bands/
channels, the STAs shall use a single 4-Way Handshake to negotiate pairwise cipher suites and establish
PTKSAs for both the current operating band/channel and the other supported band(s)/channel(s). As
specified in 11.6.6, Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way Handshake convey the RSNE and the Multi-
band element(s). The RSNE in Message 2 includes the selected pairwise cipher suite for the current
operating band/channel, and the Multi-band element(s) in Message 2 includes the selected pairwise cipher
suite(s) for the other supported band(s)/channel(s). Message 3 includes the RSNE and the Multi-band
element(s) that the STA would send in a Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, Probe Response, or Information
Response frame. Message 3 may optionally include a second RSNE and Multi-band element(s) that indicate
the STA’s pairwise cipher suite assignments for the current operating band/channel and the other supported
band(s)/channel(s). KCK and KEK associated with the current operating band/channel shall be used in the
4-Way Handshake.

 11.5.19.3 Transparent multi-band RSNA
 An RSNA initiator can establish a transparent (10.32) multi-band RSNA with an RSNA responder for both
 the current operating band/channel and the other supported band(s)/channel(s) if
    a)    Both STAs use the same MAC address in the current operating band/channel and the other
          supported band(s)/channel(s); and
    b)    At least one common pairwise cipher suite is supported by both STAs in the current operating band/
          channel and the other supported band(s)/channel(s).
 Two STAs that establish a transparent multi-band RSNA create one PMKSA and one PTKSA for both the
 current operating band/channel and other supported band(s)/channel.
 A STA shall use a single PN counter (11.4.3.3 and 11.4.5.3) for transmission in both the current operating
 band and the other supported band(s) when transparent multi-band RSNA is used.
 If the RSNA initiator does not have an existing PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the RSNA initiator shall
 first establish a PMKSA with the RSNA responder in the current operating band/channel and then use the
 PMKSA to create a PTKSA with the RSNA responder for all involved bands/channels. If the RSNA initiator
 has already established a PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the PMKSA shall be used to create a PTKSA
 between the two STAs for all involved bands/channels.
 With the PMK in place, the STA pair shall use a single 4-Way Handshake in the current operating band/
 channel to negotiate a pairwise cipher suite for all involved bands/channels and also establish a single
 PTKSA for all involved bands/channels. As specified in 11.6.6, Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way
 Handshake convey the RSNE and the Multi-band element(s). The RSNE and the Multi-band element(s) in
 Message 2 include one selected pairwise cipher suite for all involved bands/channels. Message 3 includes
 the RSNE and the Multi-band element(s) that the STA would send in a Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce,
 Probe Response, or Information Response frame. Message 3 may optionally include a second RSNE and
 Multi-band element(s) that indicate the STA’s pairwise cipher suite assignment for all involved bands/
 channels.
 11.5.19.4 Multi-band RSNA with TDLS in a non-DMG BSS
 When two multi-band capable devices operate in a non-DMG BSS and set up a TDLS direct link in the non-
 DMG BSS, the TDLS Peer Key Handshake protocol can be used to create a PTKSA for use in another
 supported band/channel that is supported by both STAs and that was indicated within both of the STA’s
 Multi-band element. Only TK in PTKSA is required for the supported band/channel and it shall be equal to
 the TPK-TK of the TPK.
 If at least one of the peer STAs has a different MAC address in the supported band/channel from that of the
 current operating band/channel, the TDLS Peer Key Handshake protocol may be used to establish a PTKSA
 for the supported band/channel. In this case, the TPK key creation method shall be used to calculate a
 different PTKSA in the supported band/channel: the TDLS peer MAC addresses and cipher suite shall be
 replaced by the MAC addresses and cipher suite indicated within the corresponding Multi-band elements
 contained in the TDLS Setup Request and Response frames used to establish the PTKSA for the supported
 band/channel.
 If two TDLS peer STAs use the same MAC addresses and pairwise cipher suites in the operating band/
 channel and in the supported band/channel, the TPKSA that is acquired by the successful completion of the
 TDLS Peer Key Handshake protocol may be used as the PTKSA for the supported band/channel.

Insert the following text, Clause 21, after Clause 20:
21. Directional multi-gigabit (DMG) PHY specification
21.1 DMG PHY introduction
21.1.1 Scope
The DMG PHY supports three modulation methods:
   —    A control modulation using MCS 0 (the control PHY; see 21.4)
   —    A single carrier (SC) modulation using MCS 1 to MCS 12 (the SC PHY; see 21.6) and MCS 25 to
        MCS 31 (the low-power SC PHY; see 21.7)
   —    An OFDM modulation using MCS 13 to MCS 24 (the OFDM PHY; see 21.5)
All these modulation methods share a common preamble (see 21.3.6).
The services provided to the MAC by the DMG PHY consist of two protocol functions, defined as follows:
   a)   A PHY convergence function, which adapts the capabilities of the physical medium dependent
        (PMD) system to the PHY service. This function is supported by the physical layer convergence
        procedure (PLCP), which defines a method of mapping the PLCP service data units (PSDU) into a
        framing format (PPDU) suitable for sending and receiving PSDUs between two or more STAs using
        the associated PMD systems.
   b)   A PMD system whose function defines the characteristics and method of transmitting and receiving
        data through a wireless medium between two or more STAs. Depending on the DMG MCSs, these
        STAs support a mixture of DMG SC PHY, DMG OFDM PHY, DMG low-power SC PHY, and
        DMG control PHY.
21.1.2 DMG PHY functions
The DMG PHY contains three functional entities: the PHY convergence function (PLCP), the layer
management function (PLME) and the PMD function. Each of these functions is described in detail in 21.3
to 21.11. The DMG PHY service is provided to the MAC through the PHY service primitives defined in
Clause 12.
21.1.2.1 DMG PLCP sublayer
In order to allow the MAC to operate with minimum dependence on the PMD sublayer, a PHY convergence
sublayer is defined (PLCP). The PLCP sublayer simplifies the PHY service interface to the MAC services.
21.1.2.2 DMG PMD sublayer
The DMG PMD sublayer provides a means to send and receive data between two or more STAs. This
subclause is concerned with SC and OFDM modulations.
21.1.2.3 PHY management entity (PLME)
The PLME performs management of the local PHY functions in conjunction with the MLME.

21.1.2.4 Service specification method
The models represented by figures and state diagrams are intended to be illustrations of the functions
provided. It is important to distinguish between a model and a real implementation. The models are
optimized for simplicity and clarity of presentation; the actual method of implementation is left to the
discretion of the DMG PHY compliant developer. The service of a layer or sublayer is the set of capabilities
that it offers to a user in the next higher layer (or sublayer). Abstract services are specified here by
describing the service primitives and parameters that characterize each service. This definition is
independent of any particular implementation.
21.2 DMG PHY service interface
21.2.1 Introduction
The PHY interfaces to the MAC through the TXVECTOR, RXVECTOR, and the PHYCONFIG_VECTOR.
The TXVECTOR supplies the PHY with per packet transmit parameters. Using the RXVECTOR, the PHY
informs the MAC of the received packet parameters. Using the PHYCONFIG_VECTOR, the MAC
configures the PHY for operation, independent of frame transmission or reception.
This interface is an extension of the generic PHY service interface defined in 7.3.4.
21.2.2 TXVECTOR and RXVECTOR parameters
The parameters in Table 21-1 are defined as part of the TXVECTOR parameter list in the PHY-
TXSTART.request primitive and/or as part of the RXVECTOR parameter list in the PHY-
RXSTART.indication primitive.

21.3.3 Common requirements
21.3.3.1 Introduction
This subclause describes the common requirement from all 4 DMG PHYs: CPHY, SC, OFDM, and low-
power SC.
For all the PHYs, all defined fields are transmitted bit 0 first in time.
21.3.3.2 Transmit RF delay
As defined at 17.3.8.5 and its value is implementation dependent.
21.3.3.3 Center frequency tolerance
21.3.3.3.1 General
The transmitter center frequency tolerance shall be ± 20 ppm maximum.

Std 802.11ad-2012                                  LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 21.3.3.3.2 Center frequency convergence
 The transmitter center frequency shall converge to within 1ppm of its final value within 0.9 μs from the start
 of the packet.
 21.3.3.4 Symbol clock tolerance
 The symbol clock frequency tolerance shall be ± 20 ppm maximum.
 The transmit center frequency and the symbol clock frequency shall be derived from the same reference
 oscillator.
 21.3.3.5 Transmit center frequency leakage
 The transmitter center frequency leakage shall not exceed –23 dB relative to the overall transmitted power
 or, equivalently, in OFDM (MCS 13-24), +2.5 dB relative to the average power of a subcarrier, measured
 over a subcarrier spacing bandwidth.
 21.3.3.6 Transmit rampup and rampdown
 The transmit power-on ramp is defined as the time it takes for a transmitter to rise from less than 10% to
 greater than 90% of the average power to be transmitted in the frame.
 The transmit power-on ramp shall be less than 10 ns.
 The transmit power-down ramp is defined as the time it takes the transmitter to fall from greater than 90% to
 less than 10% of the maximum power to be transmitted in the frame.
 The transmit power-down ramp shall be less than 10 ns.
 21.3.3.7 Antenna setting
 Antenna setting shall remain constant for the transmission of the entire packet except for the case of
 transmission of BRP-TX packets (see 21.10.2.2). During the transmission of BRP-TX packets, it shall
 remain constant for the transmission of the STF, CE field, and Data field.
 21.3.3.8 Maximum input requirement
 The receiver maximum input level is the maximum power level at the receive antenna(s) of the incoming
 signal, in dBm, present at the input of the receiver antenna for which the error rate criterion (defined in
 21.3.3.9) is met. A compliant receiver shall have a receiver maximum input level at the receive antenna(s) of
 at least 10 microwatts/cm2 for each of the modulation formats that the receiver supports.
 21.3.3.9 Receive sensitivity
 For MCS 0, the PER shall be less than 5% for a PSDU length of 256 octets with the MCS dependent input
 levels listed in Table 21-3 defined at the antenna port(s). For the other MCSs, the PER shall be less than 1%
 for a PSDU length of 4096 octets with the MCS dependent input levels listed in Table 21-3 defined at the
 antenna port(s).
 NOTE—For RF power measurements performed over the air, the input level shall be corrected to compensate for the
 antenna gain in the implementation. The gain of the antenna is the maximum estimated gain by the manufacturer. In the
 case of the phased-array antenna, the gain of the phased-array antenna is the maximum sum of estimated element gain
 minus 3 dB implementation loss.

21.3.5 Mathematical conventions in the signal description
21.3.5.1 General
The transmitted signal is described in complex base-band signal notation. The actual transmitted signal is
related to the complex baseband signal r ( t ) by the following relation:
   rRF ( t )    =     R e { r ( t ) exp ( j 2π f c t )}
where
   Re{ ⋅ }        represents the real part of a complex variable
     fc           is the center frequency of the carrier
The transmitted RF signal is generated by modulating the complex baseband signal, which consists of
several fields. The fields and the timing boundaries for the various fields are shown in Figure 21-2.

The time offset,      tField , determines the starting time of the corresponding field.
   rPPDU (t ) = rSTF (t ) + rCE ( t − tCE )
                                    + rHeader ( t − tHeader )
                                    + rData ( t − t Data )
                                    + rTRN ( t − tTRN )
where
    tCE = TSTF
    t Header = tCE + TCE
    t Data = t Header + THeader
    tTRN = t Data + TData
Each OFDM base band waveform rField ( nTS ) , for the fields above, is defined via the discrete inverse
Fourier transform as:
    rField ( nTS ) = wTField ( nTs )  X k exp ( j 2π k Δ F ( nTs − TGI ) )
                                        k
where
    Xk       is the complex constellation point to be transmitted on subcarrier k
   n         is the discrete time index
   The window wTField ( nTs ) is user defined and is used to smooth the transition between fields.

 The base band waveform for fields defined by time domain sequences or for single carrier transmission is
      rField ( nTc ) = x ( n)
 where
      x( n) is the constellation point n
 Conversion from the sampled digital domain to the continuous time domain is beyond the scope of this
 document. Filtering for pulse shaping such as in GMSK is beyond the scope of this standard.
 21.3.5.2 Windowing function
 The windowing function wTField ( nTs ) is used to smooth the transition between adjacent fields in the packet
 where OFDM modulation is employed. No windowing is applied to preamble fields or to SC modulated
 fields. The windowing function is different from being equivalent to “1” only in the transition region.

 The transition region creates an overlap (with length TR) between adjacent fields. The field wave form
  rField ( nTS ) is extended cyclically to fill the part of the transition region in which it is undefined. If the
 transition region vanishes (i.e., TR=0), the windowing function degenerates to a rectangular window. The
 choice of windowing function is implementation dependent, as long as transmit EVM and transmit mask
 requirements are met.
 21.3.6 Common preamble
 21.3.6.1 General
 The preamble is the part of the PPDU that is used for packet detection, AGC, frequency offset estimation,
 synchronization, indication of modulation (SC or OFDM) and channel estimation. The format of the
 preamble is common to both OFDM packets and SC packets.

The Short Training field is composed of 16 repetitions of sequences Ga128(n) of length 128 defined in 21.11,
followed by a single repetition of –Ga128(n).
The waveform for the Short Training field is

where
   mod is the modulus operation
21.3.6.3 Channel Estimation field
The Channel Estimation field is used for channel estimation, as well as indication of which modulation is
going to be used for the packet. The Channel Estimation field is composed of a concatenation of two
sequences Gu512(n) and Gv512(n), where the last 128 samples of Gu512(n) and Gv512(n) are equal to the last
128 samples used in the Short Training field. They are followed by a 128 samples sequence Gv128(n) equal
to the first 128 samples of both Gv512(n) and Gu512(n).
The Gu512 and Gv512 sequences are defined as
    Gu512 = [ −Gb128         −Ga128         Gb128      −Ga128 ]
    Gv512 = [ −Gb128         Ga128       −Gb128        −Ga128 ]
where
   Ga128 and Gb128 are as defined in 21.11
When the data field of the packet is modulated using single carrier, the Gu512 and Gv512 fields are
concatenated in the order illustrated in Figure 21-5. When the data field of the packet is modulated using
OFDM, the Gu512 and Gv512 fields are concatenated in the order illustrated in Figure 21-6.

 21.3.6.4 Transmission of the preamble and BRP fields in an OFDM packet
 21.3.6.4.1 General
 The preamble sequence defined in the above subclauses and the BRP fields defined in 21.10.2.2.5,
 21.10.2.2.6, and 21.10.2.2.7 are specified at the SC chip rate (Tc). For transmission in the OFDM (nominal)
 sample rate, the signal is resampled with a 3/2 rate change. The resampling is done by upsampling by a
 factor of 3, filtering by the filter hFilt defined in 21.3.6.3.1, and downsampling by a factor of 2 (see equation
 below). The resampling is performed using a specific filter hFilt since the OFDM receiver needs to know
 this filter to correct for its response during channel estimation. To define the transmission of the preamble
 when the packet is an OFDM packet, the preamble waveform is defined below.
 Let rpreamble ( nTc ) = rSTF ( nTc ) + rCE ( nTc − tce ) , where rCE is rCE or r CE       as appropriate.
                                                                               SC     OFDM

21.3.7 HCS calculation for headers of control PHY, OFDM PHY, and SC PHY
The header check sequence (HCS) is a CRC of the header bits. The header is considered to be a stream of
bits b0,...,bM-1. The CRC is based on CRC 16-CCITT. The value of the CRC field is the ones complement of
   CRC ( D ) = ( M ( D ) ⊕ I ( D ) ) D 16 mod G ( D )
where
    M ( D) = b0 DM −1 + b1DM −2 ++ bM −1 is the header bits represented as polynomial (over the binary field) where
                   b0 is bit 0 of the header and bM-1 is bit M-1 of the header
                 M −1
   I ( D) =      
              k = M −16
                        D k is an initialization polynomial added to the first 16 bits of the header (setting the shift
                   register bits to 1)
    G ( D) = D + D12 + D5 +1 is the CRC generating polynomial
                  16
   C R C ( D ) = x 0 D 1 5 + x1 D 1 4 +  x1 4 D + x1 5
The CRC field is transmitted with x15 first.
For a block diagram and an example of how to calculate the CRC, see 16.2.3.7.
21.3.8 Common LDPC parity matrices
21.3.8.1 General
Four Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are specified, each of a different rate but with a common
codeword size of 672 bits.
Each of the parity-check matrices H is partitioned into square submatrices of size Z x Z. The submatrices are
either cyclic-permutations of the identity matrix, or null submatrices with all zero entries.
A location with integer i denotes the cyclic-permutation submatrix Pi obtained from the Z x Z identity matrix
by cyclically shifting the columns to the right by i elements. The matrix Po is the Z x Z identity matrix. An
empty location denotes a null submatrix of size Z x Z.
Examples with Z = 4:

21.3.9 Scrambler
The header and data fields following the scrambler initialization field (including data padding bits) shall
be scrambled by XORing each bit in turn with a length 127 periodic sequence generated by the polynomial
 S ( x) = x7 + x4 + 1. The PLCP header bits, with the exception of the first seven bits for SC and OFDM and the
first five bits for control PHY, are placed one after the other, bit 7 first (bit 5 first for control PHY). The
octets of the PSDU and the pad bits shall be placed into a bit stream with bit 0 (LSB) of each octet first and
bit 7 of each octet (MSB) last. The generation of the sequence and the XOR operation are defined in
Figure 21-7.
                                                                                        Data In

 For each PPDU, the transmitter shall select a nonzero seed value for the scrambler (bits x1 through x7). The
 seed value should be selected in a pseudo random fashion. The seed value is sent in the Scrambler
 Initialization field of the PLCP header. Each data bit in the data field of the PPDU is then XORed with the
 scrambler output (x4 XOR x7) and the scrambler content shifted once.
 21.3.10 Received channel power indicator (RCPI) measurement
 The RCPI is a measure of the received RF power in the selected channel as measured at the DMG Antenna
 output. This parameter shall be measured by the PHY of the received RF power in the channel measured
 over the preamble of the received frame. RCPI shall be a monotonically increasing, logarithmic function of
 the received power level defined in dBm. The allowed values for the Received Channel Power Indicator
 (RCPI) parameter shall be an 8 bit value in the range from 0 to 220, with indicated values rounded to the
 nearest 0.5 dB as follows:
    — 0: Power < –110 dBm
    — 1: Power = –109.5 dBm
    — 2: Power = –109.0 dBm
 And so on up to:
    — 220: Power > 0 dBm
    — 221–254: reserved
    — 255: Measurement not available
 where RCPI = int{(Power in dBm +110) × 2} for 0 dBm > Power > –110 dBm
 RCPI shall equal the received RF power with an accuracy of ± 5 dB (95% confidence interval) within the
 specified dynamic range of the receiver. The received RF power shall be determined assuming a receiver
 noise equivalent bandwidth equal to the channel width multiplied by 1.1. The relative error between RF
 power measurements made within a 1 second interval should be less than ± 1 dB.

The Short Training field is composed of 48 repetitions of the sequence Gb128(n) of length 128, followed by
a single -Gb128(n) sequence (for synchronization) and then a single -Ga128(n) sequence. The sequences
Ga128(n) and Gb128(n) are defined in 21.11.
The waveform for the Short Training field is
where mod is the modulus operation. Note that sequences Ga128(n) and Gb128(n) are defined for 0≤n≤127.
For other n they are set to 0.

21.4.3.3 Data field
21.4.3.3.1 General
The Data field consists of the payload data of the PSDU. The PSDU is scrambled, encoded, modulated and
spread as described in the following subclauses.
21.4.3.3.2 Scrambler
The operation of the scrambler is defined in 21.3.9. Bits x1, x2, x3, x4 of the scrambler shift register are
initialized using the bits in the scrambler initialization bits from the header, bits x5, x6, x7 are set to 1. The
header is scrambled starting from bit 5. The scrambling of the data field continues the scrambling of the
header with no reset.
21.4.3.3.3 Encoder
The control PHY header and data is encoded using an effective LDPC code rate less than or equal to 1⁄2,
generated from the data PHY rate 3⁄4 LDPC parity check matrix, with shortening. The following steps are
used for the encoding:
   1)     LCWD = 168 is the maximal number of data bits in each LDPC codeword. Define LHDR =5 as the length
         of the header (including header CRC), and LFDCW is the length of the additional data in the header
         LDPC codeword in octets. Define the number of header and data bits in the first LDPC codeword as
          LDPFCW = (LHDR + LFDCW ) × 8 = 88 .      The      number        of       LDPC     codewords           is       calculated

          N CW = 1 +                    . The number of bits in the second and any subsequent codeword (if
                            LCWD       
         present), except the last, is LDPCW =  (Length − 6 )× 8 

   2)    The number of bits in the last codeword is defined as LDPLCW = (Length− 6)× 8 − ( NCW − 2) × LDPCW .
   3)    The output stream of the scrambler is broken into blocks of L = LDPFCW, LDPCW, or LDPLCW bits
                                                                                        (
         (depending on the codeword index) such that the mth data word is b1(m) , b2(m) ,...,bL(m) .           )
   4)    Each data word is padded with zeros to create 504 total bits.
   5)                                                       (
         To each data word, LCWD parity bits p 1( m ) , p 2( m ) ,..., p L( m )                )     are added to create the
                               (                                                )
                                                                                          CWD

         codeword c = b1 , b2 ,...,bL ,0,...,0, p1 , p2 ,..., pLCWD such that Hc                      =0.
   6)    The output is the stream bits generated from the codewords, with the zero padding removed from all
         codewords.
                                                                  (120 − 6 )× 8                      (120 − 6 ) × 8 

                                                                  LCWD                               LCWD           
 LDPLCW = (120 − 6)× 8 − (7 − 2) ×152 = 152 . In the first LDPC block the 40 header+HCS bits are encoded along
with additional 48 bits of the data.
21.4.3.3.4 Modulation
The scrambled and coded bit stream is converted into a stream of complex constellation points using
differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) as follows.
The encoded bit stream [ c0 , c1, c2 , c3 , c4 , .....] is converted the nondifferential stream s ( k ) = 2ck −1 . The
differential sequence is created by setting d (k ) = s(k )× d (k −1) . For the differential encoding purposes d(–1)
is defined to be 1. s( 0) is the first bit of the encoded header bits.

 21.4.4 Performance requirements
 21.4.4.1 Transmit requirements
 21.4.4.1.1 Introduction
 Transmitter performance requirements of the CPHY are defined in 21.4.4.1.2.
 21.4.4.1.2 Transmit EVM
 The transmit EVM accuracy test shall be performed by instrumentation capable of converting the
 transmitted signal into a stream of complex samples, with sufficient accuracy in terms of I/Q arm amplitude
 and phase balance, dc offsets, phase noise, etc. The instrumentation shall perform carrier lock, symbol
 timing recovery, and amplitude adjustment while making the measurements. The instrumentation shall
 incorporate a rake receiver or equalizer to minimize error resulting from multipath. If used, the equalizer
 shall be trained using information in the preamble (STF and/or CEF). For the CPHY EVM, the signal is first
 de-spread using Ga32. The EVM is then calculated on the resulting symbols according to the formula below:
                                                               

                       s avg  i =1                            
 where N S is the number of symbols to be measured and Ns should be greater than 511, P a v g is the average
 power of the constellation, ( Ii , Qi ) is the complex coordinates of the measured symbol i, and ( I i* , Q i* ) is the
 complex coordinates of the ideal constellation point for the measured symbol i.
 The test equipment should use a root-raised cosine filter with roll-off factor of 0.25 for the pulse shaping
 filter when conducting EVM measurement.
 The transmit pulse shaping used is left to the implementer.
 The EVM shall not exceed a data-rate dependent value according to Table 21-12.

 21.5.3.1.3 Generation of the HCS bits
 Calculation of the HCS for bits 0-47 of the header is defined in 21.3.7.
 21.5.3.1.4 Header encoding and modulation
 The header is encoded using a single OFDM symbol. The bits are scrambled and encoded as follows:
    1) The 64 header bits (b1, b2, ..., bLH), where LH = 64, are scrambled as described in 21.3.9, starting
          from the eighth bit, to create q=(q1,q2,...,qLH).
    2) The sequence q is padded with 440 zeros to obtain a total of 504 bits,
          (q1,q2,...,qLH,0LH+1,0LH+2,...0504), which are then encoded using the rate-3/4 LDPC code as
          described in 21.5.3.2.3.3. 168 parity bits, p1,p2,...,p168, are generated.
    3) A sequence c1 is generated as (q1,q2,...,qLH,p9,p10,...p168).
    4) A sequence c2 is generated as (q1,q2,...,qLH,p1,p2,...p84, p93,p94,...p168) XORed with a one-time
          pad sequence generated using the scrambler defined in 21.3.9, with the shift register is initialized to
          all ones.
    5) A sequence c3 is generated as (q1,q2,...,qLH,p1,p2,...p160) XORed with the continuation of the one-
          time pad sequence generated in step 4).
    6) The sequences c1,c2 and c3 are concatenated to form the 672-bit sequence
          c=(c1,c2,c3,...,c672)=(c1,c2,c3).
    7)    The 672-bit sequence, c, is then mapped as QPSK as described in 21.5.3.2.4.3, pilots are inserted as
          described in 21.5.3.2.5 and the resulting sequence d0,d1,...,dSD-1 is modulated as an OFDM symbol
          as follows:
                                                      N SR
                                1
              rHeader (qTS ) =         wTSYM (qTS )  (Dk + p1 Pk )exp ( j 2πkΔ F (qTS − TGI ))
                               N Tones             k = − N SR
          where p1 and Pk are defined in 21.5.3.2.5 and Dk is defined in 21.5.3.2.6.
 21.5.3.2 Data field
 21.5.3.2.1 General
 The data field consists of the payload data of the PSDU and possible padding. The data are padded with
 zeros, scrambled, encoded and modulated as described in the following subclauses. The amount of padding
 is defined in 21.5.3.2.3.

21.5.3.2.2 Scrambler
The operation of the scrambler is defined in 21.3.9. The scrambling of the data field continues the
scrambling of the header with no reset.
21.5.3.2.3 Encoding
21.5.3.2.3.1 General
The data are encoded by a systematic LDPC encoder. LDPC is a block code. Each block of bits (b1, b2,...,bk)
is concatenated with a block of parity bits (p1,p2,....,pn-k) to create a codeword c=( b1, b2,...,bk,p1,p2,....,pn-k)
such that HcT=0. H is an (n-k)×n parity check matrix. The block size n is 672 bits. The code rate, R, is equal
to k/n. The set of code rates is defined in Table 21-15. The parity check matrices are defined in 21.5.3.2.3.2.
The encoding process is defined in 21.5.3.2.3.3.

See 21.3.8.
21.5.3.2.3.3 LDPC encoding process
The LDPC encoding process is composed of several steps including determining the number of padding bits,
padding with zeros and the coding of every word.
   1) First the total number of padding bits NPAD is calculated, using the number of LDPC codeword NCW
         and the number of OFDM symbols NSYM:

            N CW =               

                      N × LCW 
            N SYM =  CW            
                      N CBPS 
            if BRP packet and N SYM < aBRPminOFDMblocks; N SYM = aBRPminOFDMblocks
            N PAD = R × N SYM × N CBPS − Length × 8
                                       NCBPS
         Recalculate NCW = NSYM ⋅
                                        LCW
         where LCW=672 is the LDPC codeword length, Length is the length of the PSDU defined in the
         header field, R is the code rate and NCBPS is the number of code bits per symbol as defined in the
         MCS table.
   2)    The PSDU is concatenated with NPAD zeros. They are scrambled using the continuation of the
         scrambler sequence that scrambled the PSDU.

                                        −1  )                                             (               )

 order to exploit frequency diversity. The indices k and P(k) determine which pair of OFDM subcarriers each
 pair of symbols are carried on.
 All DMG PHYs shall support Static Tone Pairing (STP) where a constant mapping between k and P(k) is
 employed. The PHY header is always encoded using STP.
 A STA may employ Dynamic Tone Pairing (DTP) where the mapping between k and P(k) are determined by
 the receiving STA and fed back to the transmitting STA. An STA may use DTP when transmitting to a DTP-
 capable STA, from which it has received DTP feedback.
 21.5.3.2.4.6.2 Static tone pairing (STP)
 When applied to the payload, STP is indicated by the Tone Pairing Type field in the PHY header set to 0.
 STP is always applied to the PHY header.
 When STP is applied, the QPSK or SQPSK symbol-pair indices k and P(k) are such that
                N SD                   N
    P(k ) = k +      for k = 0,1,2,..., SD − 1

 21.5.3.2.4.6.3 Dynamic tone pairing (DTP)
 When applied, DTP is indicated by the Tone Pairing Type field in the PHY header set to 1. DTP can be
 applied only to the payload of a PPDU employing MCS 13-17.
 When DTP is applied, the SQPSK symbol-pair indices, k and P(k), are such that

Pilot tones are inserted at tones -150, -130, -110, -90, -70, -50, -30, -10, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130,150. The
values of the pilots at these tones is [-1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1], respectively. The pilot
sequence P is created by creating a sequence of zeros corresponding to tones -NSR to NSR. The pilots are then
inserted at the corresponding tones with the values specified above.
At OFDM symbol n the pilot sequence is multiplied by the value 2×pn-1, where pn is the value generated by
the shift register defined in 21.5.3.2.2 if x1,x2,...x7 are all set to 1 at the first OFDM symbol.

 21.5.4 Performance requirements
 21.5.4.1 Transmit requirements
 21.5.4.1.1 Introduction
 This subclause describes the performance requirement from the OFDM PHY transmitter.
 21.5.4.1.2 Transmit EVM
 The transmit EVM accuracy test shall be performed by instrumentation capable of converting the
 transmitted signal into a stream of complex samples, with sufficient accuracy in terms of I/Q arm amplitude
 and phase balance, dc offsets, phase noise, etc.
 The sampled signal shall be processed in a manner similar to an actual receiver, according to the following
 steps, or an equivalent procedure:
    a) Start of frame shall be detected.
    b) Transition from short sequences to channel estimation sequences shall be detected, and fine timing
          (with one sample resolution) shall be established.
    c) Frequency offsets shall be estimated and corrected.
    d) The frame shall be de-rotated according to estimated frequency offset.
    e) The complex channel response coefficients shall be estimated for each of the subcarriers using
          information contained in the preamble (STF and/or CEF).
    f)    For each of the OFDM symbols: transform the symbol into subcarrier received values, estimate the
          phase from the pilot subcarriers, derotate the subcarrier values according to estimated phase, and
          divide each subcarrier value with a complex estimated channel response coefficient.
    g) For subcarrier, compute the Euclidean distance to the ideal location for the symbol, or pilot.
    h) Compute the RMS average of all errors in a packet. It is given by

                                                  If the Beam Tracking Request field is 0, the Training Length field
                                                  indicates the length of the training field. The use of this field is
                                                  defined in 21.10.2.2.3. A value of 0 indicates that no training field
                                                  is present in this PPDU.
                                                  If the Beam Tracking Request field is 1 and the Packet Type field
                                                  is 1, the Training Length field indicates the length of the training
                                                  field. If the Packet Type field is 0, the Training Length field

  Last RSSI                   4            39     Contains a copy of the parameter LAST_RSSI from the
                                                  TXVECTOR. When set to 0, this field is reserved and ignored by
                                                  the receiver.
                                                  The value is an unsigned integer:
                                                  Values of 2 to 14 represent power levels (–71+value×2) dBm.
                                                  A value of 15 represents a power greater than or equal to
                                                  –42 dBm.
                                                  A value of 1 represents a power less than or equal to –68 dBm.
                                                  Value of 0 indicates that the previous packet was not received a

 The header is encoded using a two SC block of NCBPB (see Table 21-20) symbols with NGI guard symbols.
 The bits are scrambled and encoded as follows:
    1) The input header bits (b1, b2, ..., bLH), where LH = 64, are scrambled as described in 21.3.9, starting
          from the eighth bit. to create d1s=(q1,q2,...,qLH)
    2)    The LDPC codeword c = (q1,q2,...,qLH,01,02,...,0504-LH,p1,p2,...,p168) is created by concatenating
          504-LH zeros to the LH bits of d1s and then generating the parity bits p1,p2,...,p168 such that HcT =
          0, where H is the parity check matrix for the rate 3/4 LDPC code specified in 21.6.3.2.3.2.
    3)    Remove bits LH+1 through 504 and bits 665 through 672 of the codeword c to create the sequence
          cs1=(q1,q2,...,qLH,p1,p2,...,p160).
    4)    Remove bits LH+1 through 504 and bits 657 through 664 of the codeword c to create the sequence
          cs2 = (q1 , q 2 ,..., q LH , p1 , p 2 ,..., p152 , p161, p162 ,..., p168 ) and then XOR with a PN sequence that is
          generated from the LFSR used for data scramblings defined in 21.3.9. The LFSR is initialized to the
          all ones vector.
    5)    cs1 and cs2 are concatenated to form the sequence (cs1, cs2). The resulting 448 bits are then mapped
          as π/2-BPSK as described in 21.6.3.2.4.2. The NGI guard symbols are then prepended to the
          resulting NCBPB symbols as described in 21.6.3.2.5.
 The same resulting NCBPB symbols are multiplied by -1 and repeated, and then prepended with NGI guard
 symbols as described in 21.6.3.2.5. The resulting sequence is then appended after the sequence created in
 step 5).

21.6.3.2 Data field
21.6.3.2.1 General
The data field consists of the payload data of the PSDU and possible padding. The data are padded with
zeros, scrambled, encoded and modulated as described in the following subclauses. The amount of padding
is defined in 21.6.3.2.3.
21.6.3.2.2 Scrambler
The operation of the scrambler is defined in 21.3.9. The scrambling of the PSDU continues the scrambling
of the header with no reset of the scrambler.
21.6.3.2.3 Encoding
21.6.3.2.3.1 General
The data are encoded by a systematic LDPC encoder. The LDPC is a block code. Each block of information
bits (b1, b2,...,bk) is concatenated with a block of parity bits (p1,p2,....,pn-k) to create a codeword c=( b1,
b2,...,bk,p1,p2,....,pn-k) such that HcT=0, where H is the (n-k)×n party check matrix. The block size n is
672 bits. The code rate, R, is equal to k/n. The set of code rates is defined in Table 21-19. The parity check
matrices are defined in 21.6.3.2.3.2. The encoding process is defined in 21.6.3.2.3.3.

21.6.3.2.3.3 LDPC encoding process
The LDPC encoding process is composed of several steps that includes deciding the number of shortening/
repetition bits in every codeword, the shortening itself, the coding of each word and then any repetition of
bits.
   1) First the total number of data pad bits NDATA_PAD is calculated, using the number of LDPC
          codewords NCW:

         for BRP packets in Table 21-23.

The transmit EVM accuracy test shall be performed by instrumentation capable of converting the
transmitted signal into a stream of complex samples, with sufficient accuracy in terms of I/Q arm amplitude
and phase balance, dc offsets, phase noise, etc.
The instrumentation shall perform carrier lock, symbol timing recovery and amplitude adjustment and
equalization while making the measurements. The equalizer shall be trained using information in the SC
preamble (STF and/or CEF). For the SC PHY EVM, measuring Ns samples at the sample rate, the measured
symbols should not contain the first and the last hundred symbols of a given packet (ramp up/down). The
EVM is calculated according to the formula below:

21.7.2.2.2 Header encoding and modulation
The low-power SC PHY header is encoded using the following scheme:
  1) The header is scrambled as described in 21.3.9.
  2) The resulting 8 octets are encoded using a RS(24,8) generating 24 octets.
  3) The resulting 24 octets are encoded in the block code (16,8) described in 21.7.2.3.3.3 generating
        48 octets.
  4) One zero octet is appended to the end of the 48 octets generating 49 octets.
  5) Each set of 7 octets is interleaved using a uniform interleaver defined in step 6) of 21.7.2.3.3.
  6) The resulting 49 octets are blocked as described in 21.7.2.3.5 and transmitted using π/2-BPSK as
        described in 21.6.3.2.4.2.
21.7.2.3 Data field
21.7.2.3.1 General
The data field consists of the payload data of the PSDU and possible padding. The data are padded with
zeros, scrambled, encoded and modulated as described in the following subclauses.

IEEE
Std 802.11ad-2012                                LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS—AMENDMENT 3:
 21.7.2.3.2 Scrambler
 The operation of the scrambler is defined in 21.3.9. The scrambling of the PSDU continues the scrambling
 of the header with no reset of the scrambler. The padding bits are also scrambled.
 21.7.2.3.3 Encoding
 21.7.2.3.3.1 General
 Data is encoded using an outer RS(224,208) block code and a short inner code. The inner code is a (16,8)
 block code for MCSs 25 and 28, a (12,8) block code for MCSs 26 and 29, and a (9,8) single parity check
 (SPC) block code for MCSs 27 and 30 and the identity block-code for MCS 31. The encoding is further
 detailed in the following steps:
    1) First, the number of block padding bits is calculated:
         a) The total number of Reed Solomon codewords is                                            and the total
               number of RS encoded symbols is given by                              ;
         b)    After Reed Solomon encoding, the data is encoded with a short block code (N,8) where N
               can take one of the following values 8, 9, 12, or 16 depending on the MCS as shown in
               Table 21-22. Therefore:
               i) The total number of encoded bits is                                             ;
               ii) The total number of 512 (in length) blocks (each containing 392 data symbols) is
                                                         . If BRP packet and                                        ,
                                              where                   . The total number of zero block padding
                     bits is                                               .
    2)   The data is broken into blocks of length 208×8 bits (except for possibly the last block).
    3)   Each block is encoded using the RS(224,208) block code as described in 21.7.2.3.3.2, except
         perhaps the last block, which is encoded by a shortened version of the code (i.e., if the last block
         length is K, the shortened block code is RS(16+K,K).
    4)   The Reed Solomon encoded data stream is further encoded using the block code(N,8) as described
         in 21.7.2.3.3.3.
    5)   The coded bit stream is concatenated with                       zeros. They are scrambled with the
         continuation of the scrambler sequence that scrambled the PSDU input bits.
    6)   Each set of 7 octets is interleaved using a uniform interleaver of 7 rows and 8 columns. The 7 octets
         are written row wise and read column wise, i.e., the index i of a bit after interleaving is related to the
         index k of a bit before interleaving by the following rule:
                                                                 where the function floor(.) denotes the largest
         integer not exceeding the function parameter.
    7)   The resulting bit stream is modulated and then blocked as described in 21.7.2.3.4 and 21.7.2.3.5.
 21.7.2.3.3.2 RS encoding
 The RS block code is based on the polynomial
 Where               is a root of the primitive polynomial                                   . We assume that an
 octet                           (b0 is the LSB) represented by the polynomial
                                                               .

21.7.2.3.4 Modulation
The same π/2-BPSK described in 21.6.3.2.4.2 and π/2-QPSK described in 21.6.3.2.4.2 are used in the DMG
low-power SC PHY.
21.7.2.3.5 Blocking
The blocking for the low-power SC is illustrated in Figure 21-17. The data is partitioned into blocks of
length 512 wherein each 512-block is constructed from 8 subblocks. Each subblock is of length 64. The first
subblock is a G64, which is the π/2-BPSK symbols sequence generated by the 64 point Golay sequence Ga64
defined in 21.11. The starting index for the first symbol π/2 rotation is 0, and subblocks 2 to 8 are

 NOTE—A STA may estimate the channel impulse response from the CEF, and decides whether to equalize using the
 512-block or the short 64-subblock. For example, if the channel impulse response energy is almost concentrated in
 8 taps, a 64-equalizer can be used; otherwise, a 512-equalizer is used.
 21.8 PLCP transmit procedure
 The PLCP transmit procedure is shown in Figure 21-18. In order to transmit data, a PHY-TXSTART.request
 primitive shall be enabled so that the PHY entity shall be in the transmit state. Further, the PHY shall be set
 to operate at the appropriate frequency through station management via the PLME, as specified in 21.12.
 Other transmit parameters, such as MCS and transmit power, are set via the PHY-SAP with the PHY-
 TXSTART.request(TXVECTOR), as described in 21.2.2.
 The PLCP shall then issue a PMD_TXSTART.request primitive, and transmission of the PLCP preamble
 shall start, based on the parameters passed in the PHY-TXSTART.request primitive. The preamble format
 (control PHY, SC or OFDM) depend on the MCS in the PHY_TXSTART.req. The PLCP shall calculate the
 length of the packet according the MCS and the length specified in the PHY_TXSTART.request primitive,
 adding padding bits if necessary.
 The PHY continues with the encoding and transmission of the header according to the
 PHY_TXSTART.req(TXVECTOR) parameters. The PHY proceeds with PSDU transmission through a
 series of data octet transfers from the MAC. The data are encoded as described in 21.4.3.2.3, 21.5.3.2.3, and
 21.6.3.2.3. The encoded data are then modulated as described in 21.4, 21.5, 21.6, and 21.7, depending on the
 MCS requested in the PHY_TXSTART.req. Transmission can be prematurely terminated by the MAC
 through the primitive PHY-TXEND.request. PHY-TXSTART shall be disabled by receiving a PHY-
 TXEND.request primitive.
 Transmission of the PSDU is completed with the transmission of the last bits of the (encoded) PSDU. If no
 TRN-T/R fields are specified in the PHY-TXSTART.req, the PLCP shall issue PMD-TXEND after the
 transmission of the last bits. If TRN-T and TRN-R are requested in the PHY-TXSTART.req, the
 transmission continues with the transmission of AGC subfields and TRN-T/R subfields. The PCLP issues
 the PMD-TXEND after the transmission of the last TRN-T/R subfield, and then it issues a
 PHY_TXEND.confirm primitive to the MAC. The packet transmission shall be completed, and the PHY
 entity shall enter the receive state (i.e., PHYTXSTART shall be disabled). Each PHY-TXEND.request
 primitive is acknowledged with a PHY-TXEND.confirm primitive from the PHY.

Upon receiving the STF, PMD_RSSI.ind shall report received signal strength to the PCLP, this indicates
activity to the MAC through PHY_CCA.ind(BUSY).
After the PHY-CCA.indication(BUSY) is issued, the PHY entity shall search for the CE field and begin
receiving the CE field. During the reception of the CE field, the PMD indicates to the PLCP the type of PHY
of the packet. The PHY demodulates the header according to the PHY type determined during the PLCP. If
the CE field indicated a SC PHY, the receiver is capable of receiving low-power SC PHY, and
dot11LowPowerSCPHYActivated is true, then the PHY shall attempt to demodulate both a SC header and
an SC low-power header. The PLCP shall decode the header and indicate to the PMD the MCS, length and
other parameters needed for the demodulation of the packet. At the end of the data portion of the packet, the
PHY shall indicate PHY_RXEND.ind(No_Error) to the MAC. If the header indicated the presence of
training field, the PMD shall continue to receive these training fields after the data portion of the packet.
After the end of these fields, the PMD shall send the measurements to the PLCP using the
PMD_CHAN_MEAS.ind. After the end of the training fields, the PHY shall indicate PHY_CCA.ind(Idle).
In the case of signal loss before the decoding of the header or in the case of an invalid header, the PHY shall
maintain PHY_CCA.ind(BUSY) for any signal 20 dB higher from the receive sensitivity of MCS 1. In the
case of signal loss after decoding of a valid header, the PHY shall indicate PHY_CCA.ind(BUSY) for the
expected duration of the packet, including AGC and TRN-T/R fields.

21.10 Beamforming
21.10.1 Beamforming concept
Beamforming enables a pair of STAs to train their transmit and receive antennas for subsequent
communication. A beamformed link is established following the successful completion of BF training,
which is described in 9.35.
DMG STAs use a quasi-omni antenna pattern. The antenna gain of the main beam of a quasi-omni antenna
pattern shall be at most 15 dB lower than the antenna gain in the main beam for a directional pattern.
21.10.2 Beamforming PHY frame format
21.10.2.1 TX sector sweep
The packets sent during TX sector sweep are control PHY packets as defined in 21.4.
21.10.2.2 Beam refinement
21.10.2.2.1 General
Beam refinement is a process where a STA can improve its antenna configuration (or antenna weight
vectors) both for transmission and reception. If the SLS beamforming training did not include an RSS, as in
the case where both devices have more than one transmit sector per antenna, beam refinement can serve as
the first receive antenna configuration training. The procedure of beam refinement is described in 9.35.6.4.
In the beam refinement procedure, BRP packets are used to train the receiver and transmitter antenna. There
are two types of BRP packets: BRP-RX packets and BRP-TX packets:
   — BRP-RX packets are packets that have TRN-R training sequences appended to them. These packets
         enable receiver antenna weight vector training.
   — BRP-TX packets are packets that have TRN-T training sequences appended to them. The
         transmitting STA may change antenna configuration at the beginning of each sequence. The
         receiving STA performs measurements on these sequences and sends feedback to the STA that
         transmits the BRP-TX packet.
21.10.2.2.2 BRP packet structure
Each BRP packet is composed of an STF, a CE field, and a data field followed by a training field containing
an AGC training field and a receiver training field.

 21.10.2.2.3 BRP packet header fields
 The Packet Type and Training Length fields present within the SC header, control PHY header, LP SC PHY
 header, and OFDM header are used to indicate that a packet is BRP packet and the length of the training
 fields, respectively.
 A value of 0x0 in the Packet Type field indicates a BRP-RX packet (TRN-R field is present).
 A value of 0x1 in the Packet Type field indicates a BRP-TX packet (TRN-T field is present).
 A value of N in the Training Length field indicates that the AGC has 4N subfields and that the TRN-R/T
 field has 5N subfields.
 The value N in the Training Length field of a BRP-RX packet is equal to the value of the L-RX field
 requested by the intended receiver of the BRP-RX packet at a previously received BRP Request field (see
 7.3a.4).
 21.10.2.2.4 BRP packet duration
 The minimum duration of the data field of a BRP packet when sent in an SC PHY is aBRPminSCblocks SC
 blocks (see 21.6.3.2.5) and, if needed, the data field of the packet shall be extended by extra zero padding to
 generate the required number of SC blocks. Table 21-23 contains the values of NCWmin for each MCS
 necessary to compute the padding described in 21.6.3.2.3.3.

The minimum duration of the data field of a BRP packet when sent with the low-power SC PHY is
            low-power SC blocks (see 21.7.2.3.3).
21.10.2.2.5 Beam refinement AGC field
The beam refinement AGC fields are composed of 4N repetitions of the sequence [Ga64 Ga64 Ga64 Ga64
Ga64] when the packet is transmitted using the OFDM or SC PHY and [Gb64 Gb64 Gb64 Gb64 Gb64] when
the packet is transmitted using the control PHY. The sequences Ga64 and Gb64 are defined in 21.11. The
sequences are transmitted using rotated π/2-BPSK modulation. Any transmit signal transients that occur due
to this TX AWV configuration change shall completely settle by the end of the first Ga64 or Gb64
subsequence.
In a BRP-TX packet, the transmitter may change the TX AWV configuration at the beginning of each AGC
subfield. The set of AWVs used for the AGC subfields should be the same as that used for the TRN-T
subfields. In a BRP-RX packet, the transmitter shall use the same TX AWV as in the preamble and data
fields of the packet.
21.10.2.2.6 Beam refinement TRN-R field
The TRN-R fields enable receiver AWV training. The TRN-R fields have the form shown in Figure 21-23.

Each subfield CE matches the Channel Estimation field defined in 21.3.6.3. The 4N subfields R1 through
R4N each consist of the sequence [Ga128 -Gb128 Ga128 Gb128 Ga128]. The sequences Ga128 and Gb128 are
defined in Table 21-24 and Table 21-25, respectively, in 21.11. The sequences are transmitted using rotated
π/2-BPSK modulation.
21.10.2.2.7 Beam refinement TRN-T field
The TRN-T field enables transmitter AWV training. The TRN-T fields have the form shown in Figure 21-
24.

                                     Figure 21-24—TRN-T field definition
Each subfield CE matches the Channel Estimation field defined in 21.3.6.3. The 4N subfields T1 through
T4N each consist of the sequence [Ga128 -Gb128 Ga128 Gb128 Ga128]. The sequences Ga128 and Gb128 are
defined in Table 21-24 and Table 21-25, respectively, in 21.11. The sequences are transmitted using rotated
π/2-BPSK modulation. When transmitting the CE subfield, the transmitter shall use the same AWV as in the
preamble and data fields of the packet. Any transmit signal transients that occur due to TX AWV
configuration changes between subfields shall settle by the end of the first 64 samples of the subfield.
21.10.2.2.8 Channel measurement
The good autocorrelation properties of the Golay sequence enable reconstructing part of the impulse
response of the channel between the transmitter and the receiver. The receiver should find the tap with
largest amplitude in the channel during the CE field of the BRP-RX. It selects thereafter the set of taps that
is measured around the tap with the largest amplitude, according to the value of
dot11ChanMeasFBCKNtaps. It can select a contiguous set of taps or select a noncontiguous set of taps,

 and include the tap delays subfield as part of the subfield measurement. It then measures the phase and
 amplitude of the corresponding channel taps in each of the TRN-T field repetition (except for those using the
 CE AWV configuration). The beam refinement feedback subfield k-1 is the relative amplitude and phase of
 this tap in the k’th repetition compared to this tap in the first TRN-T subfield.
 21.10.2.2.9 BRP resampling in an OFDM packet
 The BRP AGC, CE, and Tn/Rn fields are specified at the SC chip rate (Tc). When appended to an OFDM
 packet, the signal is resampled as defined in 21.3.3.2.
 21.11 Golay sequences
 The following Golay sequences are used in the preamble, in the single carrier guard interval and in beam
 refinement TRN-R/T and AGC fields: Ga128(n), Gb128(n), Ga64(n), Gb64(n), Ga32(n), Gb32(n). These are 3
 pairs of complementary sequences. The subscript denotes the length of the sequences. These sequences are
 generated using the following recursive procedure:
     A0 (n ) = δ (n )
     B0 (n ) = δ (n )
     Ak (n ) = Wk Ak −1 (n ) + Bk −1 (n − Dk )
     Bk (n ) = Wk Ak −1 (n ) − Bk −1 (n − Dk )
 Note that Ak (n ), Bk (n ) are zero for n < 0 and for n ≥ 2 .
                                                                k
 Ga128(n)=A7(128-n), Gb128(n)=B7(128-n) when the procedure uses Dk = [1 8 2 4 16 32 64] (k=1,2,...,7) and
 Wk = [-1 -1 -1 -1 +1 -1 -1].
 Ga64(n)=A6(64-n), Gb64(n)=B6(64-n) when the procedure uses Dk= [2 1 4 8 16 32] and Wk                =[1 1 -1 -1 1 -
 1].
 Ga32(n)=A5(32-n), Gb32(n)=B5(32-n) when the procedure uses Dk=[1 4 8 2 16] and Wk =[-1 1 -1 1 -1].
 The sequences are defined in Table 21-24, Table 21-25, Table 21-26, Table 21-27, Table 21-28, and
 Table 21-29. The sequences in the tables are normative, the description above is informative.

21.12 DMG PLME
21.12.1 PLME_SAP sublayer management primitives
Table 21-30 lists the MIB attributes that may be accessed by the PHY entities and the intra-layer of higher
level LMEs. These attributes are accessed via the PLME-GET, PLME-SET, PLME-RESET, and PLME-
CHARACTERISTICS primitives defined in 10.4.
21.12.2 DMG PHY MIB
All DMG PHY MIB attributes are defined in Annex C, with specific values defined in Table 21-30. The
column titled “Operational semantics” in Table 21-30 contains two types: static and dynamic. Static MIB
attributes are fixed and cannot be modified for a given PHY implementation. Dynamic MIB attributes can
be modified by some management entity.

 The PMD services provided to the PLCP for the DMG PHY are described in this subclause. Also defined in
 this subclause are the functional, electrical, and RF characteristics required for interoperability of
 implementations conforming to this standard. The relationship of this standard to the entire DMG PHY is
 shown in Figure 21-25.

 21.13.2 Overview of service
 The DMG PMD sublayer accepts PLCP sublayer service primitives and provides the actual means by which
 data are transmitted or received from the medium. The combined function of the DMG PMD sublayer
 primitives and parameters for the receive function results in a data stream, timing information, and
 associated receive signal parameters being delivered to the PLCP sublayer. A similar functionality is
 provided for data transmission.
 21.13.3 Overview of interactions
 The primitives provided by the DMG PMD fall into two basic categories:
    a) Service primitives that support PLCP peer-to-peer interactions
    b) Service primitives that have local significance and support sublayer-to-sublayer interactions
 21.13.4 Basic service and options
 21.13.4.1 Status of service primitives
 All of the service primitives described in 21.13.4 are mandatory, unless otherwise specified.
 21.13.4.2 PMD_SAP peer-to-peer service primitives

21.13.5.5.4 Effect of receipt
PMD_TXEND terminates transmission of a PPDU by the PMD sublayer.
21.13.5.6 PMD_TXEND.confirm
21.13.5.6.1 Function
This primitive, generated by the PMD entity, indicates the end of PPDU transmission by the PMD layer. It is
generated at the 1 μs boundary following the trailing boundary of the last symbol transmitted.
21.13.5.6.2 Semantics of the service primitive
This primitive has no parameters.
21.13.5.6.3 When generated
This primitive shall be generated by the PMD entity at the 1 μs boundary following the trailing boundary of
the last symbol transmitted.
21.13.5.6.4 Effect of receipt
The PLCP sublayer determines that transmission of the last symbol of the PPDU is complete. This
completion is used as a timing reference in the PLCP state machines.
21.13.5.7 PMD_RCPI.indication
21.13.5.7.1 Function
This primitive, generated by the PMD sublayer, provides the received channel power indicator to the PLCP
and MAC entity.
21.13.5.7.2 Semantics of the service primitive
The primitive shall provide the following parameter: PMD_RCPI.indication(RCPI).
The RCPI is a measure of the channel power received by the DMG PHY. RCPI measurement and parameter
values are defined in 21.3.10.
21.13.5.7.3 When generated
This primitive shall be generated by the PMD when the DMG PHY is in the receive state. It is generated at
the end of the last received symbol.
21.13.5.7.4 Effect of receipt
This parameter shall be provided to the PLCP layer for information only. The RCPI might be used in
conjunction with RSSI to measure input signal quality.

 21.13.5.8 PMD_TXPWRLVL.request
 21.13.5.8.1 Function
 This primitive, generated by the PHY PLCP sublayer, selects the power level used by the PHY for
 transmission.
 21.13.5.8.2 Semantics of the service primitive
 This primitive shall provide the following parameter: PMD_TXPWRLVL.request (TXPWR_LEVEL)
 TXPWR_LEVEL selects which of the transmit power levels should be used for the current packet
 transmission. The number of available power levels shall be determined by the MIB parameter
 aNumberSupportedPowerLevels. The number of available power levels are determined by the PLCP.
 21.13.5.8.3 When generated
 This primitive shall be generated by the PLCP sublayer to select a specific transmit power. This primitive
 shall be applied prior to setting PMD_TXSTART into the transmit state.
 21.13.5.8.4 Effect of receipt
 PMD_TXPWRLVL immediately sets the transmit power level to the level given by TXPWR_LEVEL.
 21.13.5.9 PMD_RSSI.indication
 21.13.5.9.1 Function
 This primitive, generated by the PMD sublayer, provides the receive signal strength to the PLCP and MAC
 entity.
 21.13.5.9.2 Semantics of the service primitive
 This primitive shall provide the following parameter: PMD_RSSI.indication (RSSI)
 The RSSI shall be a measure of the RF energy received by the DMG PHY. RSSI indications of up to 8 bits
 (256 levels) are supported.
 21.13.5.9.3 When generated
 This primitive shall be generated by the PMD after the reception of the DMG training fields.
 21.13.5.9.4 Effect of receipt
 This parameter shall be provided to the PLCP layer for information only. The RSSI may be used as part of a
 CCA scheme.

Annex L
(informative)
Change the annex title as follows:
Examples of encoding a frame for OFDM PHYs and DMG PHYs
Insert the following subclauses, L.4 to L.8.4.6 (including Figure L-1 to Figure L-17 and Table L-43 to
Table L-46), after L.3.6:
L.4 DMG example data vectors
Subclauses L.5 to L.8 contain example data vectors for the DMG PHY (see Clause 21). All of the example
data text files referenced by these subclauses are contained in a single ZIP file,
DMGEncodingExamples.zip, that is embedded in document 11-12/0751r0 (see https://mentor.ieee.org/
802.11/dcn/12/11-12-0751-00-00ad-dmg-encoding-examples.docx).
For each described node there is a cross-reference in this annex that is of the form
   Reference: <filename.txt>
where the named text file is one of the files in the ZIP file embedded in 11-12/0751r0.
Depending on the node being illustrated, the text file may represent bit data, symbol data, or sample data:
   — For bit data, the text file contains a time ordered sequence of 1 and 0 characters, separated by spaces
        and without any carriage control characters.
   — For symbol data, the text file contains a time ordered sequence of signed integers, separated by
        spaces and without any carriage control characters.
   — For sample data, the text file contains a time ordered sequence of complex values, formatted as
        ±<real>±<imag>j, separated by spaces and without any carriage control characters.
When referencing specific bits, symbols, or samples in the files, they are considered to be numbered starting
from 1.
This formatting of the text files has been chosen to facilitate import into other tools. For example, the files
can be read using the MATLAB dlmread('filename') command.
For CPHY, SC PHY and low-power (LP) SC PHY modulation samples, no spectrum shaping has been
applied to the data because the implementation of spectrum shaping is not defined in this standard. For
OFDM PHY modulation samples, no symbol shaping has been applied to the data because the
implementation of OFDM symbol shaping is not defined in this standard.

 The data payload octets are provided by a count, modulo 256, starting at 0. The resulting header and payload
 sequence is 1000 bits long, of which the first 88 bits are encoded in the header modulation block. For this
 example, with a payload of 120 octets, LDPFCW = 88, LDPCW = 152 and LDPLCW = 152.
 These numbers illustrate that the payload is not simply packed 168 bits at a time into the LDPC encoding,
 with the last few bits (modulo 168) in the last packet getting disproportionate coding gain. The specified
 calculation ensures that the excess coding gain is spread evenly across all the packets, so the number of
 payload bits in each packet varies between approximately 120 and the maximum 168.

 L.6.2.4 SC PHY LDPC data shortened bits
 Figure L-5 node . The dimension of SCPHY modulation blocks requires that the CS1 and CS2 sequences
 are each 224 bits long; this in turn requires that, in addition to the zeros, some of the parity bits are discarded
 in order to shorten the LDPC codewords to 224 bits.
 The data for the second shortened LDPC codeword is given as they are before they are scrambled to provide
 CS2.

L.6.2.6 SC PHY header samples
Figure L-5 node . The fully modulated signal after BPSK mapping, duplication (with negation), Guard
Interval addition and π/2 rotation are applied.
The 448 header bits are BPSK mapped to 448 modulation symbols and increased to 512 symbols by the
addition of a 64 symbol Guard Interval. A second, negated, copy of the 448 modulation symbols is also
increased to 512 symbols by the addition of a 64 symbol Guard Interval. The two 512 symbol blocks are
concatenated and π/2 rotated to create 1024 samples.

Figure L-6 node . The payload at node  is a count, modulo 256, starting at 0.
For MCS1 each rate 1/2 LDPC codeword encodes 168 bits (with ρ = 2 repetition) so the payload padding
calculation gives NCW = 48 and NDATA_PAD = 64.
There are 1000 × 8 = 8000 payload bits plus 64 padding bits giving a total of 8064 bits.

 L.6.3.1.3 1/2-rate LDPC encoded bits before scrambled duplication
 Figure L-6 node . The rate 1/2 LDPC encoding of each block of LZ = 168 scrambled payload bits plus
  LZ = 168 padding zero bits. In this example, the 8064 actual payload bits are doubled, by repetition, to an
 effective payload of 16128 bits, then doubled again to 32256 bits by LDPC encoding.
 This node, unique to MCS1, is the raw LDPC encoded payload bits before scrambled duplication.

 Figure L-6 node . The LDPC codewords after the LZ = 168 zeros have been replaced by the LZ = 168 re-
 scrambled data octets. The data at this node also includes the appended NBLK_PAD scrambled zeros;
 however, in this example, NBLK_PAD = 0, so there are still 32256 bits.

Figure L-9 node . The dimension of OFDM PHY modulation symbols requires that the CS1, CS2 and

L.7.4 OFDM PHY payload coding
As illustrated in Figure L-11, the LDPC encoding for the OFDM PHY case is identical to the SC PHY case,
so no additional LDPC vectors are strictly necessary. However, the equations for computing the zero
padding at the end of the payload are different from the SC PHY case so bit vectors for nodes 1, 2 and 3 are
provided.

L.7.8.4 64QAM constellation mapped data points
Figure L-15 node . For 64QAM modulation, each block of NCBPS = 2016 LDPC encoded bits is
converted in the specified manner to 336 64QAM constellation point values prior to assignment to data
carriers, in the same order as the data they were derived from.
There are 336 constellation points for each block of 2016 LDPC encoded bits, so there are 6 sets of 336
constellation points (2016 points in total) at this node.

L.7.8.5 Payload samples
Figure L-15 node . Each set of 336 constellation points is mapped to 512 frequency domain points then
inverse Fourier transformed to 512 time domain points; adding the cyclic prefix creates a 640 sample OFDM

L.8.3.1 Payload bits
Figure L-17 node . The payload at node is a count, modulo 256, starting at 0.
For MCS26, the LP SC PHY payload padding calculation gives NDATA_PAD = 368; however, unlike the
other PHYs, this padding data is not appended before FEC computation.
So there are just 1000 × 8 = 8000 payload bits.

 Figure L-17 node . In this example, there are 4 RS(224,208) codewords and one shortened RS(184,168)
 codeword, giving a total of (4 × 224 + 1 × 184) × 8 = 8640 bits at this node.

 L.8.3.5 Interleaved payload bits
 Figure L-17 node . Before interleaving the block coder output is padded with NDATA_PAD = 368
 scrambled zeros to give 13328 bits (34 x 392). The interleaver then redistributes these bits in time, as
 specified.
    Reference: LPSCPHY_MCS26_RS Encoded and Interleaved Payload bits.txt
 L.8.3.6 Payload samples
 Figure L-17 node . Each block of 392 bits from the interleaver output is BPSK mapped to 392 modulation
 symbols, prepended with a Ga64 sequence as a Guard Interval and punctuated by G8 (last 8 samples of Ga64)
 Guard Intervals, then π/2 rotated, thus resulting in a 512 symbol π/2-BPSK modulation block.
 In this example, there are 34 modulation blocks and, as specified, the last one is followed by a terminating
 Ga64 Guard Interval sequence, so there are 34 × 512 + 64 = 17472 samples at this node.

Annex Y

Functions of the centralized coordination service root (CCSR)
Via unspecified means over the DS, a centralized coordination service root (CCSR) performs the following
functions:
   — Allows APs to enroll or unenroll from the CCSS.
   — Provides a directory service, wherein the CCSR responds to a Directory Service request that
        includes a MAC address with an indication of whether the MAC address is an S-AP within the
        CCSS.
   — Configures the beacon interval, ClusterMaxMem, Beacon SP duration , TXSS Offset, TXSS CBAP
        Duration, and TXSS CBAP MaxMem (see 9.34.2.2) of each S-AP.
   — Aligns the rate of increment of TSFs of S-APs within the CCSS.
   — Configures the individual TSF offsets of each S-AP in order to minimize the temporal, spatial, and
        frequency overlap of BHIs of the BSSs in the same CCSS.
   — Provides to each S-AP the Cluster Time Offset availability information from nearby co-channel
        S-Aps.
   — Configures each S-AP with certain medium access policies for its centralized PCP/AP cluster (see
        9.34.3.4). The CCSR is permitted to configure different S-APs with different medium access
        policies.
   — Configures each S-AP with a list of one or more channels in an Operating Class that the S-AP is
        excluded from operating upon and that the S-AP advertises via the Channel Usage procedures (see
        10.23.14). The excluded channels are available to STAs that are operating in the area covered by the
        ECPAC, yet are not within the ECPAC.

TSPEC aggregation for DMG BSSs
Examples of TSPEC aggregation include, but are not limited to, the following:
   — Traffic streams between DMG STA A and DMG STA B, having an access policy of SPCA, even if
        they flow in opposite directions, sharing an SP allocation created with DMG STA A as Source AID
        and DMG STA B as Destination AID.
   — Traffic streams between DMG STA A and other DMG STAs, having an access policy of EDCA,
        even if they flow in opposite directions (some having DMG STA A as source and some having
        DMG STA A as destination), sharing a CBAP allocation created with DMG STA A as Source AID
        and broadcast Destination AID.
Figure Z-1 and Figure Z-2 show examples of TSPEC aggregation in a DMG BSS. Note that TSPEC 3 in
Figure Z-1 (for both SPCA and EDCA cases) can flow only through an RD grant.
