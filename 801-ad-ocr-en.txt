 Notice and Disclaimer ot Liability Concerning the Use oi lEEE Documents; IEEE Standards documents are developed within the lEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board. lEEE develops its standards through a consensus development process, approved by the American National Standards institute, which brings together volunteers representing varied Viewpoints and interests to achieve the ﬁnal product. Volunteers are not necessarily members of the institute and serve without compensation.
 While lEEE administers the process and establishes rules to promote iaimess in the consensus development process, lEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the iniormation or the soundness or any judgments contained in its standards.
  Use of an IEEE Standard is wholly voluntary. lEEE disclaims liability for any personal injury, property or other damage, orany nature whatsoever, whether special, indirect, consequential, or compensatory, directly or indirectly resulting from the publication, use or, or reliance upon any lEEE Standard document,  lEEE does not warrant or represent the accuracy or content of the material contained in its standards, and expressly disclaims any express or implied warranty, including any implied warranty or merchantability or ﬁtness for a speciﬁc purpose, or that the use of the material contained in its standards is tree from patent infringement, IEEE Standards documents are supplied "AS IS."  The existence or an lEEE Standard does not imply that there are no other ways to produce, test, measure, purchase, market, or provide other goods and services related to the scope of the IEEE standard. Furihen'nore, the viewpoint expressed at the time a standard is approved and issued is subjecl to change brought about through developments in the state oithe an and comments received from users olthe standard. Every lEEE standard ubiected to review at least every ten years. When a document is more than Ien years old and has not undergone a revision process, it is reasonable to conclude that its contents, although still of some value, do not wholly reﬂecl the present state or the an. Users are cautioned to check to determine that they have the latest edition orany lEEE standard,     In publishing and making its standards available, lEEE is not suggesting or rendering professional or other services for, or on behalfof, any person or entity. Nor is lEEE undenaking to perform any duty owed by any other person or entity to another. Any person utilizing any IEEE Standards document, should rely upon his or her own independent Judgment in the exercise olreasonable care in any given circumstances or, as appropriate, seek the advice oia competent protessional in detenmning the appropriateness oia given lEEE standard.
  Translations; The lEEE consensus development process involves the review oldocuments in English only. In the event that an IEEE standard is translated, only the English version published by IEEE should be considered the approved lEEE standard.
  orﬁcinl Slnlenlenls: A statement, written or oral, that is not processed in accordance with the IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual shall not be considered the ofﬁcial position ollEEE or any ofits committees and shall not be considered to be, nor be relied upon as, a fonllal position of IEEE, At lectures, symposia, seminars, or educational courses, an individual presenting infomlation on IEEE standards shall make it clear that his or her views should be considered the personal views olthat individual rather than the iomial position ofIEEE,  Comments on Standards: Commenls for revision ofIEEE Standards documents are welcome from any interested party, regardless of membership afﬁliation wilh IEEE, However, IEEE does nol provide consulting infomlation or advice pertaining to lEEE Standards documents, Suggestions for changes in documents should be in the form of a proposed change of text, together with appropriate supporting comments. Since IEEE standards represent a consensus of concerned inierests, it is important to ensure that any responses to comments and questions also receive ihe concurrence Ufa balance ofinteresls. For Ihis reason, IEEE and Ihe members ofils societies and Slandards Coordinating Committees are not able Io provide an insiani response Io comments or queslions except in those cases where ihe malier has previously been addressed, Any person who would like to participate in evaluating comments or revisions to an IEEE standard is welcome to join the relevant lEEE working group at hitg://sIandards.ieee.org’develog/wg/.

  It is useful to think of the ovals used to depict a BSS as the coverage area within which the member STAs of the BSS may remain in communication. In the case of transmissions such as in a directional multi-gizabit (DMG) BSS the individual covera e area of a transmission from one member STA to another can be thought of as a cone and hence is referred to as a directional transmission. The collection of all possible directional transmissions b a member STA deﬁnes the coverage area. (The concept of area, while not precise, is often good enough.) This area is called the Basic Service Area (BSA). Ifa STA moves out of its BSA, it can no longer directly communicate with other STAs present in the BSA.
  Insert thefallawing subcluuxe, 4.3.2a, 4ft” 4.3.2.- 4.3.2a The personal BSS (PBSS) as an ad hoc network  Similar to the IBSS, the PBSS is a type of IEEE 802.11 LAN in which STAs communicate directly with each other.
  In contrast to the IBSS, in the PBSS one STA assumes the role ofthe PBSS control point (PCP). The PCP provides the basic timing for the PBSS through DMG Beacon and Announce frames as well as allocation of service periods and contention-based access periods.

  The first component is an IEEE 802.1X port access entity (PAE). PAEs are present on all STAs in an RSNA and control the forwarding of data to and from the medium access control (MAC). An AP always implements the Authenticator PAE and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Authenticator roles, and a non-AP STA always implements the Supplicant PAE and EAP peer roles. In an IBSS or PBSS each STA implements both the Authenticator PAE and Supplicant PAE roles and both EAP Authenticator and EAP peer roles.
     A second component is the Authentication Server (AS). The AS may authenticate the elements ofthe RSNA itself, i.e., the STAs may provide material that the RSNA elements can use to authenticate each other. The AS communicates through the IEEE 802.1X Authenticator with the IEEE 802.1X Supplicant on each STA, enabling the STA to be authenticated to the AS and vice versa. An RSNA depends upon the use ofan EAP method that supports mutual authentication of the AS and the STA, such as those that meet the requirements in IETF RFC 4017. In certain applications, the AS may be integrated into the same physical device as the AF, or into a STA in an IBSS or PBSS.

PCP/AP clustering allows a PCP/AP within a cluster to schedule transmissions in nonoverlapping time periods with respect to other PCP/APs within the same cluster. There are two types of clustering:
   7 Decentralized PCP/AP clustering involves a single S-PCP/S-AP in the BSA ofthe S- PCP/S-AP.
  7 Centralized PCP/AP clustering is where there can be multiple S-APs in the BSA of any one S-AP   and all S-APs are coordinated via a single centralized coordination service set (CCSS).
  New architectural entities are introduced to support centralized PCP/AP clustering as follows. A CCSS comprises a centralized coordination service root (CCSR) and a set ofone or more synchronization APs that are stationary with respect to their local environment while operating and are connected to the CCSR via, for instance, one ofthe following:
  7 The wireless medium to an associated STA that contains the CCSR 7 The DS to an AP (or beyond, to a STA associated to the AP) 7 A combination of distribution service, portal, and external network  The CCSR is the entity that provides coordination services for the CCSS, such as selecting the target Beacon transmission time of S-APs within the CCSS to minimize interference (see Annex Y for a more detailed description of the functions of the CCSR). The CCSR might logically reside within an S-AP or in another entity as long as it has a globally administered MAC address as deﬁned in 9.2 of IEEE Std 802-2001. A CCSS is suited to an area and a frequency band having propagation characteristics so that the BSAs ofthe S- APs within a CCSS cover the area, yet transmissions within the area are isolated to a high degree.
  An extended centralized PCP/AP cluster (ECPAC) comprises a single CCSS and the set of centralized PCP/ AP clusters so that each S-AP of a centralized PCP/AP cluster is within the CCSS. The ECPAC also includes all STAs within the BSSs ofthe S-APs and member PCPs/APs ofthe centralized PCP/AP clusters.
This is shown by example in Figure 4-3a, wherein  7 STA3a and STA3b are two STAs coordinated by a one MM-SME component 7 STA4a and STA4b are two STAs coordinated by a second MM-SME component 7 The CCSR happens to be located in an external network   There are no S-PCPs in an ECPAC since a PCP has no mechanism to communicate with the CCSR.
  The CCSS is unrelated to an ESS in the sense that a CCSS might contain whole ESSs, subsets of ESSs, or some combination thereof.
   Decentralized PCP/AP clustering does not involve the use ofthe CCSS, CCSR, and ECPAC entities.

A subset ofthe QoS enhancements is available for use between STAs that are members of the same QoS IBSS. Similarly, a subset of the QoS enhancements is available for use between neighbor peer mesh STAs. A mesh BSS is one type onoS BSS, and it is described in 4.3.15. For a oS STA that is a non- DMG STA Bbecause ethienonmesh QoS STA implements a superset of STA functionality, as deﬁned in this standard, the STA might associate with a non-QoS access point in a non-QoS BSS, to provide non-QoS MAC data service when there is no QoS BSS with which to associate. As a mesh STA does not implement the necessary service, the mesh STA does not associate with any access point.
      A STA within a DMG BSS is a QoS STA‘ hence a DMG BSS is a 005 BSS.
     The enhancements that distinguish QoS STAs from non-QoS STAs and QoS APs from non-QoS APs are collectively termed the QoS/ac .

lEEE  or QoS AP implements those core QoS facilities necessary for its QoS functions to interoperate with other QoS STAs. Functions such as the Block Ack, DLS, and APSD are separate from the core QoS facilities; and the presence oftliese functions is indicated by STAs separately from the core QoS facilities.
  For infrastnicture B35, and IBSS, this standard provides four Wmechanisms for the support of applications with QoS requirements.
  The ﬁrst mechanism, designated the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA), delivers traffic based on differentiating user priorities (UPs). This differentiation is achieved by varying the following for different UP values:
  7 Amount oftime a STA senses the channel to be idle before backoff or transmission, or 7 The length of the contention window to be used for the backoff, or 7 The duration a STA may transmit after it acquires the channel.
  These transmissions may also be subject to certain channel access restrictions in the form of admission control. A DMG STA uses EDCA onlv within a contention-based access period (CBAP). Details of this mechanism are provided in 9.19.2 and for DMG STAs additional details are provided in 9.33.4 9.33.5 and 9.33.6.3.
  The second mechanism, designated the hybrid coordination function [IICF) controlled channel access (IICCA), is not applicable to DMG STAs and allows for the reservation of transm sion opportunities (TXOPs) with the hybrid coordinator (IIC). A STA based on its requirements requests the IIC for TXOPs, both for its own transmissions as well as for transmissions from the AP to itself.13 The request is initiated by the station management entity [SME) ofthe STA. The IIC, which is collocated at the AP, either accepts or rejects the request based on an admission control policy. Ifthe request is accepted, the IIC schedules TXOPs for both STAs [both the AP and the non-AP STA). For transmissions from the non-AP STA, the IIC polls the STA based on the parameters supplied by the STA at the time of its request. For transmissions to the STA, the AP directly obtains TXOPs from the collocated 11C and delivers the queued frames to the STA, again based on the parameters supplied by the STA. Details of the mechanism are provided in 9.19.3 and 10.4. This mechanism may be used for applications such as voice and video, which may need periodic service from the IIC. If the application constraints dictate the use oftliis mechanism, the application initiates this mechanism by using the management service primitives.
  The third mechanism designated the service period (SP) access or service [IErlOd channel access (SPCA) is anplicable only to the DMG STAs and allows for the reservation of channel time b the PCP/AP. A non- PCP/non-AP STA requests the PCP/AP for SPs which can be used for transmission to anv other STA in the B35. The request is initiated by the SME of the non-PCP/non-AP STA. The PCP/AP either accents or reiects the request based on an admission control polic . Iftlie request is accepted the PCP/AP uses the Extended Schedule element to schedule SPs for communication between the source and destination DMG STAs indicated within the request. Details of this mechanism are nrovided in 9.33.6.2 9.33.6.4 9.33.6.6 and 10.4.
  The fourth mechanism designated as dtrnarnic allocation is annlicable onlv to the DMG STAs and allows for near-real-time reservation ofchannel time with the PCP/AP. This t ne ofaccess is used in addition to the service period and contention-based access neriod mechanisms. A PCP/AP can Bell a STA and receive requests for channel time allocation. Based on the received requests the PCP/AP can accept a request and immediatel allocate (within the same beacon interval) channel time for the STA to communicate with another STA b usimz a Grant frame. Details oftliis mechanism are provided in 9.33.7 9.33.8 and 9.33.9.
  Non-QoS STAs may associate in a QoS BSS, ifallowed to associate by the AP. All individually addressed  frames that are sent to non-QoS STAs by an AP do not use the frame formats associated with the QoS facility.

4.3.17 DMG STA  The lEEE 802.11 DMG STA provides PIIY and MAC features that can support a throughput of] Gb/s and greater, as measured at the MAC data service access point (SAP). A DMG STA supports DMG features as identiﬁed in Clause 9, Clause 10, and Clause 21. A DMG STA operates in a DMG BSS and supports transmission and reception of frames that are compliant with PIlY speciﬁcations as deﬁned in Clause 21. A DMG STA is also a QoS STA. The basic channel access ofa DMG STA (see 9.33) allows it to operate in an Infrastructure BSS, in an IBSS, and in a PBSS. Certain DMG features such as service period allocation are available only to DMG STAs that are associated with an AP or with a PCP, while other DMG features such as EDCA operation in a PBSS do not require association. A DMG STA supports beamfomiing (BF) as described in 9.35 and 21.10 and GCM encryption as described in 11.4.5.
  A DMG STA supports the PHY signaling as described in 21.4, 21.5, 21.6, and 21.7. At a minimum, a DMG STA supports the mandatory modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and PLCP protocol data unit (PPDU) fomiats described in 21.4 and 21.6. A DMG STA has PIIY features that include a low-density parity check (LDPC) encoding, a preamble making use of Golay sequences, and beamfonning. The PPDUs are always transmitted with the same channel spacing as described in Annex E.
  A DMG STA supports MAC features that provide cliannel access in an environment in which transmissions use a directional antenna patteni. A DMG STA has MAC features that include frame aggregation, Block Ack features, service periods, contention-based access periods, DMG protected period, PCP/AP clustering, dynamic channel time management, reverse direction, spatial sharing, beamfonning, and operation (fast session transfer) in a multi-band device. A DMG STA is not a mesh STA. A DMG STA follows the same channel access rules irrespective ofthe type ofBSS in which it operates.
  4.3.18 DMG relay  The $02.11 DMG relay function allows a source relay endpoint DMG STA (REDS) to transmit frames to a destination REDS with the assistance of another DMG STA, the relay DMG STA (RDS), as shown in Figure 4-10a. Relaying can improve the reliability ofcommunication in a DMG BSS in the case the direct link between the source REDS and the destination REDS has poor quality or is disrupted. Following the DMG relay setup procedures, a source REDS can discover and select an appropriate RDS to act as the relay for a particular destination REDS, prior to data frame transmission using the relay. A relay operating as a link switching type of relay uses the RDS to forward frames between the source and destination REDS iftlie direct link between the REDS is disrupted. In a link cooperating type of relay operation, the RDS simultaneously repeats the transmission of frames between the source and destination REDS, which can possibly increase the signal quality received at the destination REDS.

  The services that apply to an IBSS are the SSs. A QoS IBSS supports operation under the IICF using TXOPs gained through the EDCA mechanism. The parameters that control differentiation ofthe delivery of MSDUs with different priority using EDCA are fixed. A QoS IBSS has no HC and does not support polled TXOP operation and setting up of‘TSPEC.
  The services that apply to the PBSS are the 58s and the PCPSs as described in 4.4.2a. A PBSS supports operation under the IICF usin TXOPs ained through the EDCA mechanism. In a PBSS the EDCA mechanism is used only within CBAPs. The parameters that control differentiation of traffic classes usin EDCA can be configured b the PCP in a PBSS. The PCP ofa PBSS has no IIC but can support TSPEC setup DMG TSPEC setup and service periods.
  In an IBSS, each STA enforces its own security policy. In an E85 and a PBSS, an AP and a PCP can1 respectively enforce a uniform security policy across all STAs.

If using nontransparent FST, the multi- band management entity can employ a combination of the source and destination MAC address s in both the old and new band/channel to conﬁgure the routing of MSDUs and MLME primitives within the STA. If using transparent FST, in addition to the MAC addresses, the multi-band management entity can employ the TID ofan FST session for this routing.
  The multi-band procedures (see 10.32) allow a pair of multi-band capable devices to discover, synchronize, (de)authenticate, [re)associate, disassociate, and manage resources with each other on any common band/ channel that is supported by both STAs.
  When used in the context ofFST, the term “session” refers to llon-PIIY state infomlation that is kept in a pair of STAs that communicate directly (i.e., excludes forwarding) and that is available prior to and following a session transfer. This state illfonnation is different depending if transparent or nontrallsparent is used. For transparent FST, a shared multi-band management entity has access to the local infomlation within each SME; and in this case the state illfonnation includes BA agreements, TSs, association state, RSNA, security keys, sequence counter, and PN counter. For nolltransparent FST, the function of the multi-balld management entity is restricted to coordinating the setup and teardown ofa session transfer with no access to other local information within each SME. Therefore, with nontransparellt FST, any illfonnation local to all SME needs to be reestablished for the new band/channel, and this can be done either prior to or following the session transfer (see 10.32).

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  By using the on-channel tunneling (OCT) multi-band procedure described in 1032.4, the SME ofa multi- band capable device can instruct one ofits MLMEs to use the OCT services provided by another MLME of the same multi-band capable device to communicate with a peer MLME of a peer multi-band capable device. This enables the SMEs ofa pair ofmulti-band capable devices to provide a seamless FST, including performing (de)authentication and [re)association across bands/channels. The MLMEs that use the OCT services provided by another MLME within the same multi-band capable device to communicate are referred to as being on-the-air disabled with respect to each other. Following an FST, two peer on-the-air disabled MLMEs can become on-the-air enabled with respect to each other.
  As described in 5.1.5, a MAC address is not unique within the multi-band capable device when transparent FST is intended to be used. When transparent FST is used, a single MAC SAP at each peer is presented to the higher layers of that peer for all the frequency bands/channels that are identiﬁed by the same MAC address at that peer. When nontransparent FST is used, different MAC SAPs are presented to higher layers since different MAC addresses are used prior to and following an FST session transfer. Therefore, when nontransparent FST is used, higher layers are responsible for managing the session transition between different frequency bands/channels.
  Each MAC SAP is controlled by a separate and independent RSNA key management entity and 802.1X Authenticator/Supplicant, unless if transparent FST is used in which case the multi-band management entity is responsible for coordinating with each ofthe SMEs to ensure that a single RSNA key management entity and 802.1X Authenticator/Supplicant are shared among the MACs and that a single 802.1X entity is controlled.

4.10.4a PBSS functional model description   This subclause summarizes the system setup and operation of an RSNA in a PBSS.
  If a non-PCP STA chooses to associate with the PCP ofthe PBSS, the non-PCP STA establishes an RSNA with the PCP following the infrastructure functional model as speciﬁed in 4.10.3.
  If a non-PCP STA wants to establish an RSNA with the PCP without association or if the non-PCP STA wants to establish an RSNA with another non-PCP STA, it can directly initiate an RSNA authentication with the peer STA, followed by a 4-Way Ilandshake. One difference between this model and the IBSS functional model is that only one RSNA authentication and one 4-Way Ilandshake are perfomied between two STAs.
 If both STAs initiate an RSNA setup at the same time, the RSNA setup initiated by the STA with the lower MAC address is carried through, while the RSNA setup initiated by the STA with the higher MAC address is terminated.
  Figure 4-23a shows an example of the RSNA setup in a PBSS. An initiator STA discovers a peer STA’s RSNA policies through the DMG Beacons from the peer STA if the peer STA is the PCP or through the Probe Response or lnfomiation Response frames from the peer STA. In this example, the initiator STA does not associate with the peer STA. The initiator STA may optionally perfomi RSNA authentication with the peer STA to derive a PMK. A 4-Way IIandshake is then started to complete the RSNA setup.

     In an IBSS/PBSS GAS functionality enables a STA to access the availability and information related to desired services provided by other STAs in the IBSS/PBSS. Exchange of infomiation using GAS may be nerformed either nrior to ioininz an IBSS/PBSS or after ioinin the IBSS/PBSS,      There are a number ofreasons why providing information to a STA in a preassociated state is beneﬁcial:
  7 It supports more informed decision making about an IEEE 802.11 infrastructure or PBSS with which to associate. This is generally more efﬁcient than requiring a non-PCP/non-AP STA to associate with an PCP/AP before discovering the information and then deciding whether to stay associated.
   7 It is possible for the non-PCP/non-AP STA to query multiple networks in parallel.
  7 The non-AP STA can discover infomiation about Al’s that are not part of the same administrative group as the AP with which it is associated, supporting the selection of an AP belonging to a different IEEE 802.11 infrastructure that has an appropriate SSP roaming agreement in place.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  5. MAC service definition  5.1 Overview of MAC services 5.1.5 MAC data service architecture Change theﬂrxt and seenmlpuragraphx, and inter! a new third paragraph in 5.1.5 uxﬂlllawx:
  The MAC data plane architecture (i.e., processes that involve transport of all or part of an MSDU) is shown in Figure 5-2 for when transparent FST is used and shown in Figure 5-1 othenvise. During transmission, an MSDU goes through some or all of the following processes: MSDU rate limiting, aggregate MSDU (A- MSDU) aggregation, frame delivery deferral during power save mode, sequence number assignment, fragmentation, encryption, integrity protection, frame fomiatting, and aggregate MAC protocol data unit (A- MPDU) aggregation. When transparent FST is used an MSDU goes through an additional transparent FST entity that contains a demultiplexin process that forwards the MSDU down to the selected TX MSDU Rate Limitin process and thence further MAC data plane processin . IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 may block the MSDU at the Controlled Port. At some point, the data frames that contain all or part of the MSDU are queued per AC/TS.
  During reception, a received data frame goes through processes ofpossible A-MPDU deaggregation, MPDU header and cyclic redundancy code (CRC) validation, duplicate removal, possible reordering if the Block Ack mechanism is used, decryption, defragmentation, integrity checking, and replay detection. After replay detection (or defragmentation if security is not used), possible A-MSDU deaggregation, and possible MSDU rate limiting, one or more MSDUs are delivered to the MACisAP or to the DS. When transparent FST is used MSDUs originating from different PIlY-SAPs go throu 11 an additional transparent FST entity that contains a multiplexing process before forwardin the MSDU to the MSDU rate limiting process. The IEEE 802.1X Controlled/Uncontrolled Ports discard any received MSDU iftlie Controlled Port is not enabled and ifthe MSDU does not represent an IEEE 802.1X frame. Frame order enforcement provided by the enhanced data cryptographic encapsulation mechanisms occurs after decryption, but prior to MSDU defragmentation; therefore, defragmentation fails if MPDUs arrive out of order.
  When transparent FST is used the same security keys sequence counter and PN counter are used b the MAC data plane to encr pt tlie MPDU prior to and following an FST session transfer and the same securit  ke s are used to check the integrit and perform the protection of MSDUs. When nontransparent FST is used independent RSNAs security ke s scouence counters and PN counters have to be established for each MAC data plane to be used prior to and following an FST session transfer. Wlien transparent FST is used a single MAC SAP at each peer is presented to the hi her layers of that peer for all the frequenc  bands/channels that are identiﬁed by the same MAC address at that peer. When nontransparent FST is used different MAC SAPs are presented to higher layers since different MAC addresses are used prior to and   following an FST n transfer.

6.3.89 On-channel Tunneling operation  6.3.89.1 General  On-channel tunneling (OCT) primitives are used as part ot‘multi-band operation [see 10.32). OCT frames are used to transport management frames between peer MLME entities of multi-band capable devices.
  The operation ofthe OCT is illustrated in Figure 6-25b,  Multi-band capable device Multi-band capable device  SME NT—MLME TR-MLME TR-MLME NT-MLME SME     (mm MMF'DU)  Orv-channel Tunnel quuesl frame MLME.
ocrtmnehnd        (marveled MMPDU l        Figure 6—25b—0peration of OCT  An initiator MLME of a STA that might not be currently enabled to transmit generates a MLME- OCTunnel.request primitive to a local MLME entity of a STA that is enabled to transmit. This request carries the contents ot‘a management frame and replaces transmission on-tlie-air of that frame.
  The recipient MLME generates the MLME-OCTunnel.indication primitive to the local MLME entity identiﬁed in the On-channel Tunnel Request frame,  The direct MLME-to-MLME primitive exchange should be viewed as shorthand for an exchange through the SMEs and multi-band entity, i,e., an MLME addresses another local MLME entity by sending that primitive through its SME and the multi-band entity to the SME of the MLME entity of a STA that is enabled to transmit, which reﬂects that primitive to the appropriate recipient,  6.3.89.2 MLME-OCTunnel.request  6.3.89.2.1 Function  This primitive requests transmission of an On-channel Tunnel Request frame,

  For a non-DMG STA in which the More Data Ack subfield of its QoS Capability element is 1 and that has APSD enabled, an AP optionally sets the More Data field to l in ACK frames to this STA to indicate that the AP has a pending transmission for the STA.
  For a STA with TDLS peer PSM enabled and the More Data Ack subﬁeld equal to l in the QoS Capability element of its transmitted TDLS Setup Request frame or TDLS Setup Response frame, a TDLS peer STA optionally sets the More Data ﬁeld to l in ACK frames to this STA to indicate that it has a pending transmission for the STA.

  The A-MSDU subframe header contains three ﬁelds: DA, SA, and Length. The order of these ﬁelds and the bits within these ﬁelds are the same as the IEEE 802.3 frame format. The DA and SA ﬁelds of the A-MSDU subframe header contain the values passed in the MA-UNITDATA.request and MA-UNITDATA.indication primitives. The Length ﬁeld contains the length in octets ofthe MSDU.
  An A-MSDU contains only MSDUs whose DA and SA parameter values map to the same receiver address (RA) and transmitter address (TA) values, i.e., all the MSDUs are intended to be received by a single receiver, and necessarily they are all transmitted by the same transmitter. The rules for determining RA and TA are independent of whether the frame body carries an A-MSDU.
  NO'I‘Eilt is possible [0 have thrrereht DA and SA parameter values in A-MSDU stthrrame [readers of the same A- MSDU as long as they all map to the same Address 1 and Address 2 parameter values.
  The MPDU containing the A-MSDU is carried in any ofthe following data frame subtypes: 005 Data, QoS  Data + CF-Ack, QoS Data + CF-Poll, QoS Data + CF-Ack + CF-Poll. The A-MSDU structure is contained in the frame body ofa single MPDU. If encrypted, the MPDU is encrypted as a single unit.

  7 When setting up a TS, the DMG STA that transmits an ADDTS Request frame containing a TSPEC or FTP TSPEC element sets the Allocation ID to a nonzero value to identify the allocation it requires to carry the TS. Alternatively, the same DMG STA sets the Allocation ID to 0 to indicate any CBAP allocation with the broadcast AID as Source AID.
  7 When setting up a TS, the DMG STA that transmits the ADDTS Response frame containing the TSPEC or FTP TSPEC element sets the Allocation ID to a nonzero value that identiﬁes the allocation carrying the TS. Alternatively, the same DMG STA sets the Allocation ID to 0 to indicate any CBAP allocation with the broadcast AID as Source AID and Destination AID.
  7 When deleting a TS, the DMG STA that transmits the DELTS frame containing a TSPEC or FTP TSPEC element sets the Allocation ID to a nonzero value to identify the allocation that is carrying the TS to be deleted. Alternatively, the same DMG STA sets the Allocation ID to 0 to indicate no allocation exists to carry the TS to be deleted.
  7 The Allocation Direction subﬁeld is 1 bit in length. It is equal to 1 when the originator of the ADDTS Request is also the source of the allocation identiﬁed by Allocation ID and is equal to 0 otherwise. The Allocation Direction subfield is equal to 0 when the Allocation ID subﬁeld is equal to 0.
  7 The A-MSDU Subframe subﬁeld is I bit in length and contains a value that indicates the A-MSDU subtrame structure to be used for this TS. The A-MSDU Subframe subﬁeld is set to O to indicate the Basic A-MSDU subframe structure and set to 1 to indicate the Short A-MSDU subframe structure.
  7 The Reliability subﬁeld is 2 bits in length and contains an expected reliability index. The reliability index refers to the PER ofthe PIIY (PSDU Packet Error Rate as in 21.3.3.9). The relation between the reliability index and the PER is shown in Table 8-1 10a.
  The Reliability subﬁeld in an ADDTS Request frame that has the Direction subfield set to downlink or in an ADDTS Response frame that has the Direction ﬁeld set to uplink indicates the receiver’s expectation ofthe PER for this TS. The Reliability subﬁeld in an ADDTS Request frame that has the Direction subfield set to uplink or in an ADDTS Response frame that has the Direction field set to downlink is reserved. The reliability information is provided by the SME using the MLME- ADDTS.request primitive and MLME-ADDTS.response primitives. Together with the link margin (9.37) and other implementation-speciﬁc information, this value can be used by the transmitter to estimate the MCS to be used for this particular TS.

lEEE  9.2.2 DCF Change 9.22 uxfallaws:
  The fundamental access method of the IEEE 802.11 MAC used by non-DMG STAs is a DCF known as carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The DCF shall be implemented in all STAs.
  For a STA to transmit, it shall sense the medium to determine if another STA is transmitting. If the medium is not detemlined to be busy (see 9.3.2.1), the transmission may proceed. The CSMA/CA distributed algorithm mandates that a gap ofa minimum speciﬁed duration exist between contiguous frame sequences.
 A transmitting STA shall ensure that the medium is idle for this required duration before attempting to transmit. If the medium is detemlined to be busy, the non-DMG STA shall defer until the end of the current transmission, and a DMG STA may defer until the end ofthe current transmission. After deferral, or prior to attempting to transmit again immediately after a successful transmission, the STA shall select a random backoff interval and shall decrement the backoffinterval counter while the medium is idle. A transmission is successful either when an ACK frame is received from the STA addressed by the RA ﬁeld ofthe transmitted frame or when a frame with a group address in the RA field is transmitted completely. A reﬁnement of the method may be used under various circumstances to further minimize collisionsihere the transmitting and receiving STAs exchange short control frames (RTS and CTS frames for non-DMG STAs and RTS and DMG CTS frames for DMG STAs) after determining that the medium is idle and after any deferrals or backoffs, prior to data transmission. The details of CSMA/CA, deferrals, and backoﬁs are described in 9.3.
  RTS/CTS and RTS/DMG CTS exchanges are also presented in 9.3.

  Transmission of fragmented MPDUs by a DMG STA outside ofan A-MPDU depends on setting of the No- Fragmentation ﬁeld in the ADDBA Extension elelnent within the ADDBA Response frame transmitted during the BA agreement handshake. The MSDU shall not be fragmented if the No-Fragmentation field in the ADDBA Extension element within the ADDBA Response frame transmitted during the BA agreement handshake is 1. If the No-Fragmentation ﬁeld in the ADDBA Extension elelnent within the ADDBA Response frame is 0, the originator may send fragmented nonaggregated MSDU with Nomlal ACK policy under BA agreement.

A DMG STA has no direct knowledge of when it might interfere (collide with the transmission of) another STA.
  The CS function ofa DMG STA might not indicate the medium busy condition due to the predominant nature of directional transmissions and receptions. The transmission ofa STA might interfere (collide) with the transmission of another STA even though the CS function at the first STA does not indicate medium busy. The interference (collision) is identified when the expected response frame is not received. SPSII is achieved by the proper combination of the STA antenna conﬁguration during the media access and data transfer phases.
   Charrge the rmw twelfth paragraph in 9.3.1 axfallawx:
  All STAs that are members of a BSS are able to receive and transmit at all the data rates in the BSSBasicRateSet parameter of the MLME-START.request primitive or BSSBasicRateSet parameter of the BSSDescription representing the SelectedBSS parameter of the MLME-JOIN.request primitive; see 6.3.4.2.4 and 6.3.11. 4. All HT STAs and DMG STAs that are members ofa BSS are able to receive and transmit using all the MCSs in the BSSBasicMCSSet parameter of the MLME-START.request primitive or BSSBasicMCSSet parameter ofthe BSSDescription representing the SelectedBSS parameter ofthe MLME- JOIN.request primitive; see 6.3.4.2.4 and 6.3.11.2.4. To support the proper operation of the RTS/CTSbv non-DMG STAs RTS/DMG CTS by DMG STAs and the virtual CS mechanism, all non-DMG STAs shall be able to interpret control frames with the Subtype field set to RTS or CTS and all DMG STAs shall be able to interpret control frames with the Subt ne field set to RTS or DMG CTS.
           Insert the fanawtrrg paragraph at the end of 9.3.1.-  While in the WAKE state and operating under DCF but not transmitting, a DMG STA can configure its receive antenna to a quasi-omni pattern in order to receive frames transmitted by any STA that is covered by this antenna pattern.
  9.3.2 Procedures common to the DCF and EDCAF 9.3.2.1 CS mechanism Change the thin] amIfmlrth [mmgmphx af 9.3.2.1 axfalhrws:
  A virtual CS mechanism shall be provided by the MAC. This mechanism is referred to as the NAV. The NAV maintains a prediction offuture traffic on the medium based on duration infomiation that is announced in RTS/CTS frames b non-DMG STAs and RTS/DMG CTS frames b DMG STAs prior to the actual exchange of data. The duration infomiation is also available in the MAC headers of all frames sent during the CPA other than PS-Poll frames and during the BTI the A-BFT the ATI the CBAP and the SF. The mechanism for setting the NAV using RTS/CTS or RTS/DMG CTS in the DCF is described in 9.3.2.4, use of the NAV in PCF is described in 9.4.3.3, and the use of the NAV in IICF is described in 9.19.2.2 and 9.19.3.4. Additional details regarding NAV usage and update appear in 9.3.2.5, 9.3.2.11, 9.33.10 and 9.23.
           The CS mechanism combines the NAV state and the STA’s transmitter status with physical CS to detemiine the busy/idle state of the medium. The NAV may be thought ofas a counter, which counts down to O at a unifonn rate. When the counter is 0, the virtual CS indication is that the medium is idle; when the counter is  Copyngm© 2012 IEEE.

  The time interval between frames is called the IFS. A STA shall detemiine that the medium is idle through the use of the CS function for the interval specified.

  : The transmitter is a DMG STA and each transmission occurs with the same transmit antenna configuration.
  RIFS shall not be used between frames with different RA values. The duration of RIFS is deﬁned by the aRIFS PIIY characteristic (see Table 20-25 and Table 21-31). The RIFS is the time from the end ofthe last symbol ofthe previous frame to the beginning ofthe first symbol ofthe preamble of the subsequent frame as seen at the air interface. A STA shall not allow the space between frames that are defined to be separated by a RIFS time, as measured on the medium, to vary from the nominal RIFS value (aRlFSTime) by more than i 10% of aRlFSTime.

The SlFS may also be used by a PC for any type of frame during the CFP [see 9.4). The SlFS is the

  The SIFS timing shall be achieved when the transmission of the subsequent frame is started at the TxSlFS Slot boundary as speciﬁed in 9.3.7. An IEEE 802.11 implementation ofa non-DMG STA shall not allow the space between frames that are deﬁned to be separated by a SIFS time, as measured on the medium, to vary from the nominal SIFS value by more than i 10% ofaSlotTime for the PIIY in use. An implementation ofa DMG STA shall not allow the space between frames that are deﬁned to be separated by a SIFS time as measured on the medium to var from the nominal SIFS value b more than 70% or +10% ofaSlotTime.
        SIFS is the shortest of the lFSs between transmissions from different STAs. SIFS shall be used when STAs have seized the medium and need to keep it for the duration of the frame exchange sequence to be performed. Using the smallest gap between transmiss ons within the frame exchange sequence prevents other STAs, which are required to wait for the medium to be idle for a longer gap, from attempting to use the medium, thus giving priority to completion of the frame exchange sequence in progress.
  When transmitting a response frame immediatel followin a SIFS period a DMG STA shall set the TXVECTOR parameter LAST RSS1 ofthe response frame to the power that was measured on the received packet as reported in the RCPI ﬁeld ofthe frame that elicited the response frame. The encodin ofthe value 's as follo               7 Power values less than or equal to 768 dBm are represented as the value of 1.

   Power values equal to or above 742 dBm are represented as the value 15.
  : For all other cases the DMG STA shall set the TXVECTOR parameter LAST RSS1 of the transmitted frame to 0.
     A DMG STA that transmits a PPDU containing at least one individuall addressed MPDU shall set the TXVECTOR parameter Tumaround to 1 if the DMG STA is required to listen for an incoming PPDU immediatel followin the transmission ofthe PPDU' otherwise the DMG STA shall set the TXVECTOR parameter Turnaround to 0.

lEEE   Change the seventh paragraph af 9.3.4.3 axﬂllluwx:
  The effect ofthis procedure is that when multiple STAs are deferring and go into random backoff, then the STA selecting the smallest backofftime using the random function wins the contention (assuming all ofthe contending STAs detect the same instances of WM activity at their respective receivers a situation that is not always true due to hidden node effects and interference events). The number of DMG STAs that are able to detect each WM transmission is reduced even further due to SPSII.
        1mm thefnllnwing text at the end of 13.4.3.-  Figure 9-12b describes the backoff procedure for DMG STAs for the example topology shown in Figure 9- 12a.
  At the time that STA A starts transmitting a frame to STA E and STA E starts receiving the frame, the antennas of both stations are directed to the peer, i.e., the transmitting antennas of STA A are directed to STA E and the receiving antennas of STA E are directed to STA A. At this point, STA B, STA C, and STA D are not involved in any frame exchange; therefore, they are in receiving state and happen to have the conﬁguration of their receiving antenna arrays set to a quasi-omni antenna pattem to be ready to receive frames from any STA.
  STA B receives the frame transmitted by STA A (to STA E), and CS (physical and virtual) in STA B indicates a busy medium during the exchange between STA A and STA E.
  STA D is not able to receive the frame transmitted by STA A or the response transmitted by STA E; hence CS in STA D indicates IDLE for the duration ofthe exchange between STA A and STA E.
  The physical CS function ofSTA C indicates a medium busy condition when it receives the response sent by STA E, but indicates an idle medium condition during the transmission from STA A.
  STA A and STA E (which are directly involved in the frame exchange), STA B (which received the frame sent by STA A), and STA C (which received the response sent by STA E) are synchronized at point A, where the transaction between STA A and STA E completes.
       Since STA D cannot hear the directional transmis. ns from either STA A or STA C, its physical CS indicates an idle medium condition for the duration ofthe frame exchange, enabling a frame exchange with STA B at the same time as the frame exchange between STA A and STA E. This is an example of SPSII.
  Because STA C is unaware of the transmission of the frame from STA A to STA E, STA C transmits an RTS to STA B. But STA C does not receive a DMG CTS from STA B since the CS at STA B is busy when STA B receives the RTS from the STA C. This causes STA C to retry the RTS transmission following the expiration of a backoff count, which occurs after the completion of the exchange between STA A and STA E.

  In the absence ofa PCF or use ofthe group addressed transmission service (GATS), when group addressed MPDUs in which the To DS field is 0 are transferred trom a STA, only the basic access procedure shall be used. When group addressed MPDUs are not delivered using GATS, no RTS/CTS or RTS/DMG CTS exchange shall be used, regardless of the length of the frame. In addition, no ACK shall be transmitted by any of the recipients of the frame. Any group addressed MPDUs in which the To DS field is I transferred from a STA shall, in addition to conforming to the basic access procedure ofCSMA/CA, obey the rules for RTS/CTS exchange and the ACK procedure because the MPDU is directed to the AP. For DMG STAs the MPDU transmission shall also confonn to the access procedures defined in 9.33. When dotl lSSPNInterfaceActivated is true, an AP shall distribute the group addressed message into the BSS only if dotl lNonAPStationAnthSourceMnlticast in the dotl llnterworkingEntry identified by the source MAC address in the received message is true. When dotl lSSPNInterfaceActivated is false, the group addressed message shall be distributed into the BSS. Unless the MPDU is delivered via DMS, the STA originating the message receives the message as a group addressed message (prior to any filtering). Therefore, all STAs shall ﬁlter out group addressed messages that contain their address as the source address. When dotl lSSPNInterfaceActivated is false, group addressed MSDUs shall be propagated throughout the ESS.
 When dotl lSSPNInterfaceActivated is true, group addressed MSDUs shall be propagated throughout the ESS only if dotl lNonAPStationAuthSourceMulticast in the dotl llnterworkingEntry identiﬁed by the source MAC address in the received message is true.

   A DMG STA shall not transmit an A-PPDU aggregate to a STA that is not A-PPDU capable.
  An A-PPDU is a sequence of two or more PPDUs transmitted without IFS, preamble, and separation between PPDU transmissions. All PPDUs within an A-PPDU shall have the ADD-PPDU parameter of the TXVECTOR set to ADD-PPDU, except for the last PPDU in the A-PPDU that shall have this parameter set to NO-ADD-PPDU. The value of fields within the PLCP header ofa PPDU belonging to an A-PPDU might differ from other PPDUs in the same A-PPDU, including the MCS ﬁeld.
  A PPDU within an A-PPDU shall contain an A-MPDU. All MPDUs within A-MPDUs within an A-PPDU shall have the same values for the TA and RA ﬁelds. All QoS Data MPDUs within A-MPDUs within an A- PPDU shall have the same value ofthe Ack Policy subfreld ofthe QoS Control field.

  9.18 Operation across regulatory domains 9.18.2 Operation upon entering a regulatory domain Change the szcand paragraph af 9.13.2 usfnllnws:
  When a STA with dotl lMultiDomainCapabilityActivated true enters a regulatory domain, before transmitting, it shall passively scan to learn at least one valid channel, i.e., a channel upon which it detects IEEE 802.11 frames. The Beacon frame transmitted b non-DMG STAs and DMG Beacon/Announce frame transmitted by DMG STAs contains information on the country code, the maximum allowable transmit power, and the channels that may be used for the regulatory domain. Optionally, they Beacon frames may also include in the Country element, on a periodic basis, the regulatory information that would be returned in a Probe Response frame. When DSE-dependent STA operation is required in a regulatory domain, a dependent STA may be required to receive a Beacon frame or a DMG Beacon/Announce trame signaling dependent enablement (10.125), and until dais—Beacon at least one ofth 'e frame s received, the STA may continue passive scanning to receive Msuch a—Beaeeprframe directly from an enabling STA. Once the STA has acquired the information so that it is able to meet the transmit requirements of the regulatory domain, it shall transmit a Probe Request to an @AP to gain the additional necessary regulatory domain information contained in the Probe Response frame, unless the infomiation was previously received in a

     9.18.6 Operation with coverage classes Change 9.18. 6 axﬁrlllrws:
  The default PIlY parameters are based on aAirPropagationTime having a value of 1 ps or less, and aSlotTime and other MAC timing are based on the PIIY timing parameters, as specified in 9.3.2.3 and 9.3.7.
 When dotl lOperatingClassesRequired is true, it is possible to manage the MAC timing of STAs that can receive Beacon frames DMG Beacon frames or Probe Response frames that contain the Country element (8.4.2.10), to increase faintess in contending for the medium. Radio waves propagate at 300 m/ps in free space, and, for example, 3 ps would be the ceiling for BSS maximum one-way distance of~450 m (N900 in round trip). The Coverage Class field of the Country element indicates the new value of aAirPropagationTime (see Table 8-56), and the MAC can use the new value to calculate aSlotTime (see 9.3.7). When dotl10peratingClassesRequired and dotl1ExtendedChannelSwitchActivated are true and Country elements have been received in Beacon frames DMG Beacon frames or Probe Response frames, associated STAs and dependent STAs shall use MAC timing that corresponds to the new value of aAirPropagationTime (see 9.3.7).
        Using the Country element, an ﬂAP can change coverage class and maximum transmit power level to enhance operation. When dotl lOperatingClassesRequired and dotl 1ExtendedChannelSwitchActivated are true and the maximum transmit power level is different from the transmit power limit indicated by the operating class, the associated STA or dependent STA shall operate at a transmit power at or below that indicated by the lesser ofthe two limits.
  9.19 HCF 9.19.1 General Change 9.19. I axﬂllluwx:
  Under IICF, the basic unit of allocation of the right to transmit onto the WM is the TXOP. Each TXOP is deﬁned by a starting time and a deﬁned maximum length. In a non-DMG network tIhe TXOP may be obtained by a STA winning an instance of EDCA contention (see 9.19.2) during the CP or by a STA receiving a QoS (HCF-Poll frame [see 9.19.3) during the CP or CFP. The fomier is called EDCA TXOP, while the latter is called HCCA TXOP orpolled TXOP. An llCCA TXOP shall not extend across a TBTT. A TXOP shall not exceed dotl 1MawaellTime (ifusing an Fll PIIY). The occurrence ofa TBTT implies the end of the llCCA TXOP, after which the regular channel access procedure [EDCA or llCCA) is resumed. It is possible that no frame was transmitted during the TXOP. The shortened termination ofthe IICCA TXOP does not imply an error condition.
     In a DMG BSS the EDCAF operates only durin CBAPs. Operation ofthe EDCAF is suspended at the end ofa CBAP and is resumed at the beginning of the following CBAP. When the EDCAF is being suspended the values of the backoffand NAV timers shall remain unchanged until the start ofthe followin CBAP. A TXOP ma be obtained only within a CBAP. A TXOP ma be obtained by a DMG STA winning an instance of EDCA contention (see 9.19.2) or b a DMG STA receiving a Grant frame with the AllocationT ne ﬁeld caual to 1. See 9.33.5 and 9.33.6.3 for additional rules regarding contention-based access in DMG BSSs.
   llCCA is not used by DMG STAs.

  When a STA gains access to the channel using EDCA and empties its transmission queue, it may transmit a CF-End fralne provided that the remaining duration is long enough to transmit this frame. By transmitting the CF-End frame, the STA is explicitly indicating the colnpletion of its TXOP. In a DMG BSS the STA shall not send a CF-End with a nonzero value in the Duration/ID ﬁeld if the remaining duration is shorter   than 2 X TXTIME CF-End + 2 X SIFS.
     A TXOP holder that transmits a CF-End frame shall not initiate any further frame exchange sequences within the current TXOP.
   A non-AP STA that is not the TXOP holder shall not transmit a CF-End frame.
In a non-DMG network aA STA shall interpret the reception of a CF-End frame as a NAV reset, i.e., it  resets its NAV timer to 0 at the end ofthe PPDU containing this frame. After receiving a CF-End frame with a matching BSSID, an AP may respond by transmitting a CF-End frame after SIFS.

  Those 51 A5 are prevented from contending for the medium until the original NAV reservation expires.
         In a DMG BSS a STA that is not in the Listening Mode (9.33.6.6) shall interpret the reception ofa CF-End frame as a NAV reset i.e. it resets its NAV timer to 0 at the end ofthe time interval indicated in the value of the Duration/ID field of the received frame. The interval starts at PIIY-RXEND.indication of the frame reception. The STA shall not transmit during the interval if the RA ﬁeld ofthe frame is not equal to the STA MAC address. The STA lna transmit a CF-End frame ifthe RA field of the received frame is equal to the STA MAC address and the value of the Duration/ID field in the received frame is not equal to 0.

lEEE  Figure 9-21 shows an example of TXOP truncation. In this example, the STA accesses the medium using EDCA channel access and then transmits a nav-set sequence [e.g., RTS/CTS for non-DMG STAs or RTS/ DMG CTS for DMG STAs) (using the temtinology of Annex G). After a SIFS, it then transmits an initiator- sequence, which may involve the exchange of multiple PPDUs between the TXOP holder and a TXOP responder. At the end of the second sequence, the TXOP holder has no more data that it can availablete send that fits within the TXOP; therefore, it truncates the TXOP by transmitting a CF-End frame.
   Figure 9-21 remuinx unchanged.
  Non-DMG STAs that receive a CF-End frame reset their NAV and can start contending for the medium without further delay. DMG STAs that receive a CF-End frame can start contending for the medium at the end ofthe time interval equal to the value in Duration/ID ﬁeld of the frame if none ofits NAV timers has a   nonzero value 9.33.10 .
     TXOP truncation shall not be used in combination with L-SIG TXOP protection when the IIT Protection ﬁeld ofthe IIT Operation element is equal to nonmember protection mode or non-IIT mixed mode.
  9.21 Black Acknowledgment (Black Ack) 9.21.1 Introduction Change the szcand and thirdpurugnlphx of 9.21.1 ax fallawx:
  The Block Ack mechanism is initialized by an exchange of ADDBA Request/Response frames. After initialization, blocks of QoS data frames may be transmitted from the originator to the recipient. A block may be started within a polled TXOP within an SP or by winning EDCA contention. The number of frames in the block is limited, and the amount of state that is to be kept by the recipient is bounded. The MPDUs within the block of frames are acknowledged by a BlockAck control frame, which is requested by a BlockAckReq frame.
     The Block Ack mechanism does not require the setting up ofa TS; however, QoS STAs using the TS facility may choose to signal their intention to use Block Ack mechanism for the scheduler’s consideration in assigning TXOPs. The Block Ack mechanism is also used by the OCR service. Acknowledgments of frames belonging to the same TID, but transmitted during multiple TXOPsﬂ, may also be combined into a single BlockAck frame. This mechanism allows the originator to have ﬂexibility regarding the transmission ofdata MPDUs. The originator may split the block of frames across TXOPsﬂ, separate the data transfer and the Block Ack exchange, and interleave blocks of MPDUs carrying all or part of MSDUs or A-MSDUs for different Tle or RAs.

  9.25.4 Rules for RD responder Change 9.25.4 axﬂlllnws:
  An RD responder shall transmit the initial PPDU ofthe RD response burst a SIFS after the reception of the RDG PPDU. PPDUs in a response burst are separated by SIFS or RIFS. The RIFS rules in the RD are the same as in the forward direction; the use of RIFS is constrained as deﬁned in 9.3.2.3.2 and 9.23.3.3.
  NOTE7The transmission of a response by the RD responder does not constitute a new ehannel access but a continuation of the RD inttiator’s TXOI’ or SP. An RD responder ignores the NAV when responding to an RDG.
  The recipient of an RDG may decline the RDG by 7 Not transmitting any frames following the RDG PPDU when no response is otherwise required, or 7 Transmitting a control response frame with the RDG/More PPDU subﬁeld set to 0, or 7 Transmitting a control response frame that contains no IIT Control ﬁeld  An RD responder that is a non-DMG STA may transmit a +CF-ACK non-A-MPDU frame in response to a non-A-MPDU QoS Data +HTC MPDU that has the Ack Policy ﬁeld set to Normal Ack and the RDG/More PPDU subﬁeld equal to l.

A DMG STA operating as a PCP or AP generates the schedule and communicates it to STAs using DMG Beacon and Announce frames. A non-PCP STA that is a non-AP STA and that receives scheduling information accesses the medium during the scheduled periods using the access rules speciﬁc to that period. Medium access rules to establish a BSS are deﬁned in 9.34 and 10.1.4.
  In the ATI, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall be ready to receive a transmission from the PCP/AP at least RxAdvanceTime before the expected transmission ofa request frame. The destination STA of an SP shall be ready to receive a transmission from the source STA ofthe SP at least RxAdvanceTime before the start of the SP. A STA that participates in a CBAP shall be ready to receive a transmission within the CBAP at least RxAdvanceTime before the start of the CBAP plus DIFS. In the A-BFT, the PCP/AP should be ready to receive a transmission from a non-PCP/non-AP STA at least RxAdvanceTime before the start of an SSW slot. In all the preceding rules, RxAdvanceTime is deﬁned as follows:
  RxAdvunceTime 7 ceiling [[ClackAa-urat'y (ppm) x 10*] x Dri/r1merval+ izAirPrapagatianTime, aTSFRe.rolutian)  where Dri/ilmewul is the time elapsed since a synchronizing reference event. The synchronizing event is the reception of the Timestamp ﬁeld from the PCP/AP.
  9.33.2 Access periods within a beacon interval  Medium time within a DMG BSS is divided into beacon intervals. Subdivisions within the beacon interval are called access periods. Different access periods within a beacon interval have different access rules. The access periods are described in a schedule that is communicated by the PCP or AP to the non-PCP and non- AP STAs within the BSS. The schedule communicated by the PCP or AP can include the following access periods:
 7 BTI: An access period during which one or more DMG Beacon frames is transmitted. Not all DMG Beacon frames are detectable by all non-PCP and non-AP STAs. Not all beacon intervals contain a BTI. A non-PCP STA that is a non-AP STA shall not transmit during the BTI ofthe BSS of which it is a member.
 7 A»BFT: An access period during which beamfonning training is perfomied with the STA that transmitted a DMG Beacon frame during the preceding BTI. The presence ofthe A-BFT is optional and signaled in DMG Beacon frames.
  7 AT]: A request-response based management access period between PCP/AP and non-PCP/non-AP STAs. The presence ofthe AT] is optional and signaled in DMG Beacon frames.
  7 DTI: An access period during which frame exchanges are performed between STAs. There is a single DTI per beacon interval.
   The DTI, in turn, comprises contention-based access periods (CBAPs) and scheduled service periods (SPs).

The ATI shall not start before TBTT ifthe ATI is the first period in the beacon interval [the ATI is never the first period in the beacon interval in an infrastructure BSS; see 10.1.2.1). Once the ATI starts, the PCP/AP may start transmission of a request frame immediately or it may delay the transmission of the request frame ifthe medium is determined by the CCA mechanism to be busy.
  During each ATI the PCP/AP shall schedule transmissions to a non-PCP/non-AP STA ifthe non-PCP/non- AP STA IIeartbeat ﬁeld in the STA’s DMG Capabilities element within the Association Request frame of the last successful association attempt is 1 and the non-PCP/non-AP STA is in the Awake state. If the non- PCP/non-AP STA does not respond to the frame transmitted by the PCP/AP, the PCP/AP shall use the DMG Control modulation class (9.7.5a.l) at its next transmission attempt to the non-PCP/non-AP STA. The PCP/ AP shall use the DMG Control modulation class for all subsequent transmissions to the non-PCP/non-AP STA until it receives a valid frame from the non-PCP/non-AP STA.
  A non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not transmit during the ATI except in response to a received individually addressed frame whose TA field contains the PCP/AP’s MAC address and whose RA field contains the STA’s MAC address.
  During the ATI STAs shall not transmit frames that are not request or response frames. Request and response frames transmitted during the ATI shall be one ofthe following:
  7 A frame of type Management  7 An ACK frame  7 A Grant, Poll, RTS or DMG CTS frame when transmitted as a request frame 7 An SPR or DMG CTS frame when transmitted as a response frame  7 A frame of type Data only as part of an authentication exchange to reach a RSNA security association  NOTE7The Announce frame rs designed rd be used primarily during the ATI and can perform functions of a DMG Beacon fratue.
  The transmission of P011 frames during the ATI follows the rules described in 9.33.7. The Response Offset field within a Poll frame transmitted during the ATI shall be set to 0.
  Individually addressed request frames transmitted during the ATI shall not be sent using management frames of subtype action no ACK.
  During the ATI, after a PCP/AP transmits an individually addressed request frame (such as an Announce frame) to a non-PCP/non-AP STA, and the STA receives that frame, the STA shall transmit a response frame addressed to the PCP/AP. The transmission ofthe response frame shall commence one SIFS period after the successful reception of the request frame. The PCP/AP shall interpret the receipt of the response frame as an acknowledgment of the request frame. Response frames transmitted by non-PCP/non-AP STAs during the ATI shall be individually addressed to the PCP/AP.
  NOTE7STAs do not transmit a response frame to tire PCP/AP when they receive a request frame from the PCP/AP with the RA equal to a group address (see 9.3.2.9 and 9.3.5).
  The Duration field ofa request frame transmitted during the ATI shall be set to cover the remaining duration of the ATI at the end of the request frame transmission. The Duration field of a response frame transmitted during the ATI shall be set to the value of the Duration field within the previously received request frame minus SIFS and minus the duration ofthe response frame transmission.
  When a transmission by a STA is expected by a PCP/AP and a SIFS period elapses without its receipt, the  PCP/AP may either repeat its individually addressed transmission to that STA or, as early as one PIFS after the end of its previous transmission, transmit a frame to any other STA.
      

page 280
lEEE  NOTE7II' aekuowledgmenl is required, the PCP/AP transmits an ACK frame to acknowledge the reception of a response frame during the ATI (see Figure 9.44).
  Multiple request and response frame exchanges between the PCP/AP and a STA might occur during a single ATI.
  During the AT] the PCP/AP should schedule transmissions to non-PCP/non-AP STAs in power save mode before transmissions to non-PCP/non-AP STAs that are not in power save mode.
  9.33.4 DTI transmission rules  During the DTI, a STA may transmit frames (following the DMG cliannel access rules) if any of the following conditions are met:
a) During a CBAP for which the STA is identiﬁed or included as source or destination (9.33.6.3, 9.33.7, and 9.33.8)  b) During an SP for which the STA is identiﬁed as source or destination [9.33.6.2 and 9.33.7)  and shall not transmit if none ofthese conditions are met. A STA initiating data transfer shall check that the transaction, including acknowledgments, completes before the end of tlie CBAP or SP in which it was initiated.
  When the entire DTI is allocated to CBAP [that is, the CBAP Only ﬁeld is 1 in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld), the ATI Present ﬁeld within the DMG Beacon containing the DMG Parameters ﬁeld shall be set to 0.
  Non-PCP/non-AP DMG STAs shall be capable of processing the P011 and Grant frames and the Extended Schedule element. A PCP/AP shall be capable of processing the SPR frame transmitted by a non-PCP/non- AP STA and responding to a SPR frame with a Grant frame.
  The DMG low-power SC PIIY [21.7) may be used only within SPs that have the LP SC Used subﬁeld within the Extended Schedule element equal to 1 and shall not be used otherwise. A STA supports the DMG low-power SC PIIY ifthe Low-Power SC PIIY Supported subﬁeld within its DMG Capabilities element is 1. A STA that supports the DMG low-power SC PIIY shall not transmit a PPDU using the DMG low-power SC PIIY unless the STAs identified in the RA ﬁeld of all MPDUs contained within the PPDU support the DMG low-power SC PIIY. A STA can use the procedure described in 10.291 to discover the capabilities of another STA.
  9.33.5 Contention-based access period (CBAP) transmission rules   The deﬁnition of contention-based transmission rules used within a CBAP is provided in 9.3 and in 9.19.
  This subclause speciﬁes additional rules applicable to the CBAP.
   A STA shall not transmit within a CBAP unless at least one ofthe following conditions is met:
  7 The value of the CBAP Only field is equal to 1 and the value ofthe CBAP Source ﬁeld is equal to 0 within the DMG Parameters ﬁeld ofthe DMG Beacon that allocates the CBAP  7 The STA is a PCP/AP and the value ofthe CBAP Only ﬁeld is equal to 1 and the value ofthe CBAP Source ﬁeld is equal to 1 within the DMG Parameters ﬁeld oftlie DMG Beacon that allocates the CBAP  7 The value ofthe Source AID ﬁeld ofthe CBAP is equal to the broadcast AID 7 The STA’s AID is equal to the value ofthe Source AID ﬁeld ofthe CBAP 7 The STA’s AID is equal to the value ofthe Destination AID ﬁeld ofthe CBAP

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  Ifa STA’s AID is equal to the value ofthe Source AID ﬁeld ofa CBAP allocation or ifa STA performs in the role of PCP/AP and both the CBAP Only and CBAP Source ﬁelds are equal to l in the DMG Beacon that allocates a CBAP, the STA may initiate a frame transmission within the CBAP immediately after the medium is detennined to be idle for one PIES period.
  A BF initiator (9.35) should not initiate an SLS phase within a CBAP ifthere is not enough time within the CBAP to complete the SLS phase.
  A STA shall not extend a transmission frame exchange sequence that started during a CBAP beyond the end ofthat CBAP. A STA that initiates a sequence shall check that the frame exchange sequence, including any control frame responses, completes before the end ofthe CBAP.
  At the beginning ofa TXOP with a TXOP responder that has the Heartbeat ﬁeld in the TXOP responder‘s DMG Capabilities element equal to l, the following mles apply:
  7 The TXOP holder shall transmit a frame to the TXOP responder using the DMG Control modulation class before it uses any other modulation class for transmission if the time elapsed since the last frame received from the TXOP responder is larger than or equal to the Ileartbeat Elapsed Time value computed using the Heartbeat Elapsed Indication ﬁeld within the TXOP responder‘s DMG Capabilities element.
  7 The TXOP holder may transmit a frame using a modulation class other than the DMG Control modulation class at the start of the TXOP if the time elapsed since the last frame received from the TXOP responder is shorter than the Heartbeat Elapsed Time value computed using the Heartbeat Elapsed Indication ﬁeld within the TXOP responder’s DMG Capabilities element.
   The frame sent by the STA at the beginning ofthe TXOP may be an RTS or a DMG CTS-To-Self.
  Within a CBAP a STA with multiple DMG antennas should use only one DMG antenna in its frame transmission, CCA and frame reception, except if it is the initiator or responder in an SLS (9.35). The algorithm to select a DMG antenna and switch the active DMG antenna is implementation dependent.
 Within CBAPs a STA that changed to a different DMG antenna in order to transmit should perform CCA on that DMG antenna until a frame sequence is detected by which it can correctly set its NAV, or until a period oftime equal to the dotl lDMGPmbCDClay has transpired, whichever is earlier.
  9.33.6 Channel access in scheduled DTI 9.33.6.1 General   The PCP/AP schedules each allocation with a speciﬁed start time from the TSF and with a ﬁxed duration.
 An allocation can be an SP, where ownership of channel time is granted to a single STA, or a CBAP, where STAs can compete for channel access. The PCP/AP shall reference the start time of each allocation from the TSF.
  The PCP/AP may schedule SPs or CBAPs only during the DTI ofa beacon interval, following the end of an allocated BTI, A-BFT, and ATI when any ofthese periods are present in the beacon interval.
  The schedule of the DTI ofa beacon interval is communicated through the Extended Schedule element. The PCP/AP shall transmit the Extended Schedule element in either or both an Announce frame or a DMG Beacon frame. The Extended Schedule element shall contain the scheduling information ofall allocations in the DTI. The same Allocation ﬁeld shall not appear more than once in the Extended Schedule element transmitted in a beacon interval. The content ofthe Extended Schedule element communicated in a beacon interval shall not change if transmitted more than once in the beacon interval, except that if the STA transmitting the Extended Schedule element is a PCP with multiple DMG antennas then the value of the PCP Active ﬁeld of CBAP allocations within the Extended Schedule element might change when this      

page 282
IEEE  element is transmitted through different DMG antennas. The PCP/AP should schedule SPs for a STA such that the scheduled SPs do not overlap in time with the trafﬁc scheduling constraints indicated by this STA in the TSCONST ﬁeld ofthe associated DMG TSPEC element.
  When scheduling a nonpsendo-static SP or changing the start time ofan existing pseudo-static SP that has a non-PCP/non-AP STA as a source DMG STA or as a destination DMG STA ofthe SP, a PCP/AP shall set the start time of the SP to no less than aMinAllocationDeliveryTime after the last Extended Schedule element containing this SP is transmitted by the PCP/AP.
  NOTEiThis rule does not apply to me case when a PCP/AP schedules :1 new pseudo-static s1),  An SP or CBAP allocation within an Extended Schedule element may comprise one or more individual allocations. The start time of each individual allocation of an SP or CBAP is given by  (Aimn + (i e 1) x A jer‘iad)  where A7321er is the value of the Allocation Start ﬁeld for the SP or CBAP Ajeriad is the value ofthe Allocation Block Period ﬁeld for the SP or CBAP i is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to the value ofthe Number ofBlocks ﬁeld for the SP or CBAP  The end ofthe I'm individual SP or CBAP allocation is computed by adding the start time ofthe im individual allocation to the value ofthe Allocation Block Duration ﬁeld for the corresponding SP or CBAP allocation.
  If the PCP Active subﬁeld in the Allocation ﬁeld for an allocation within an Extended Schedule element is l, the PCP shall be in the receive state for the duration ofthat allocation, except when transmitting during that allocation. The AP shall set the PCP Active ﬁeld to one for every allocation within an Extended Schedule element transmitted by the AP.
  9.33.6.2 Service period (SP) allocation  The PCP/AP shall set the AllocationType subﬁeld to 0 in an Allocation ﬁeld within an Extended Schedule element to indicate an SP allocation.
  An SP is assigned to the source DMG STA identiﬁed in the Source AID subﬁeld in an Allocation ﬁeld within the Extended Schedule element. The source DMG STA shall initiate the frame exchange sequence that takes place during the SP at the start ofthe SP, except when the source DMG STA intends to establish a DMG Protected Period in which case the rules described in 9.33.6.6 shall be followed before the source DMG STA initiates the frame exchange in the SP. The SP allocation identiﬁes the TC or TS for which the allocation is made; however, the type of trafﬁc transmitted is not restricted to the speciﬁed TC or TS (10.4.1).
  Except when transmitting a frame as part ofthe SP recovery procedure (9.33.6.7) or transmitting a response to the source DMG STA or transmitting a PPDU as pan ofa RD response burst (9.25), the STA identiﬁed by the Destination AID ﬁeld in the Extended Schedule element should be in the receive state for the duration of the SP in order to receive transmissions from the source DMG STA. If the Destination AID ﬁeld of the scheduled SP is equal to the broadcast AID and if the Source AID ﬁeld ofthe scheduled SP is not equal to the broadcast AID, then all STAs on the PBSS/infrastructure BSS should be in the receive state in order to receive transmissions from the source DMG STA for the duration ofthe SP. Subclause 9.33.7 describes the mles for when the scheduled SP has both the Source and Destination AID ﬁelds equal to the broadcast AID.
  Only a STA identiﬁed as the source DMG STA or destination DMG STA of an SP shall transmit during the SP, except when the rules in 9.33.7, 9.33.8, or 9.33.9 are used.

The frame sent by the STA may be an RTS or a DMG CTS-To-Self. The frame sent by the STA may be a SSW frame or a BRP packet ifthe STA is performing beamforming [9.7.5a.5).
  At the beginning ofan SP, a destination DMG STA shall transmit a frame to the source DMG STA using the DMG Control modulation class before it uses any other modulation for transmission ifthe IIeartbeat ﬁeld in the source DMG STA’s DMG Capabilities element is l and the frame sent by the destination DMG STA is the unsolicited DMG DTS as ﬁrst frame in the SP ofthe STA perfomiing DMG Protected Period (9.33.6.6).
  Any MAC entity coordinated by an MM-SME that belongs to an MMSL cluster identiﬁed by the Source AID and Destination AID that are equal to, respectively, the Source AID and Destination AID of the Allocation ﬁeld in the Extended Schedule element that allocates the SP may transmit during the SP, if the STA sent an MMS element to the peer STA and the BeamLink Cluster ﬁeld within the MMS element is l.
  The PCP/AP may create SPs in its beacon interval with the source and destination AID subﬁelds within an Allocation ﬁeld set to 255 to prevent transmissions during speciﬁc periods in the beacon interval.
  The PCP/AP shall set the Beamforming Training subﬁeld to one in the Allocation ﬁeld for an SP within an Extended Schedule element to indicate that the source DMG STA ofthis SP initiates beamfonning training with the destination DMG STA at the start ofthat SP. The source DMG STA and destination DMG STA of the SP shall perfomi beamfonning training as described in 9.35.
  If the PCP Active subﬁeld is 0 in the Allocation ﬁeld for an SP within an Extended Schedule element, neither the destination DMG STA ofthe SP nor the source DMG STA of the SP shall transmit to the PCP during the SP if none ofthe STAs are the PCP.
  In no case shall the source or destination DMG STA extend a transmission frame exchange sequence that started during an SP beyond the end ofthat SP. A STA that initiates a sequence shall check that the frame exchange sequence, including any control frame responses, completes before the end ofthe SP.
  When scheduling two adjacent SPs, the PCP/AP should allocate the SPs separated by at least aDMGPPMinListeningTime ifone or more ofthe source or destination DMG STAs participate in both SPs.
  Except for frames used for beamforming as described in 9.35, the source of an SP may retransmit a frame PIFS after the end of the frame transmission in case a response frame is expected from the destination DMG STA and a SIFS period elapses without receipt ofthe expected transmission.
  The source DMG STA can relinquish the remainder of an SP to the destination DMG STA by sending a Grant frame to the destination DMG STA (9.33.7.3).
  9.33.6.3 Contention-based access period (CBAP) allocation  The PCP/AP shall set the AllocationType subﬁeld to l, the Source AID subﬁeld to the broadcast AID or to the AID ofthe source ofthe CBAP, and the Destination AID subﬁeld to the broadcast AID or to the AID of the destination ofthe CBAP in an Allocation ﬁeld within an Extended Schedule element to indicate a CBAP allocation.
  All CBAPs are allocated by the PCP/AP, except when allocated by a non-PCP/non-AP STA with the  transmission ofa Grant frame following an SP truncation (9.33.8). Multiple CBAPs may be present in a beacon interval, with the location and duration of each detemiined by the PCP/AP and announced in the      

page 284
lEEE  Extended Schedule element. When only one CBAP is present and no other allocations exist for the DTI, then the PCP/AP shall announce the presence of the CBAP by setting the CBAP Only ﬁeld to l in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld of the DMG Beacon. If at least one non-CBAP allocation is present, or more than one CBAP are present, or no allocations are present within a DTI, then the PCP/AP shall set the CBAP Only ﬁeld to 0 in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld in the DMG Beacon transmitted during the ET]. The PCP/AP shall set the CBAP Only ﬁeld to 0 in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld within a transmitted DMG Beacon if the DMG Beacon contains at least one Extended Schedule element.
  When the entire DTI is allocated to CBAP through the CBAP Only ﬁeld in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld, then that CBAP is pseudo-static and exists for dotllMaxLostBeacons beacon intervals following the most recently transmitted DMG Beacon that contained the indication, except if the CBAP is canceled by the transmission by the PCP/AP ofa DMG Beacon with the CBAP Only ﬁeld of the DMG Parameters ﬁeld equal to 0 or an Announce frame with an Extended Schedule element. A guard time (9.33.6.5) precedes a CBAP that is allocated through the CBAP Only ﬁeld equal to 1.
   Channel access during a CBAP shall follow the rules described in 9.33.5.
9.33.6.4 Pseudo-static allocations  An SP or CBAP allocation is pseudo-static ifthe Pseudo-static ﬁeld in the Allocation control ﬁeld for the SP or CBAP is l, or when the Extended Schedule element is not used and the CBAP Only ﬁeld within the DMG Parameters ﬁeld ofthe DMG Beacon frame is 1 (9.33.6.3). A pseudo-static SP or CBAP recurs at the same relative offset to TBTT and with the same duration in up to dotl lMaxLostBeacons beacon intervals following the last received Extended Schedule element containing the pseudo-static allocation or DMG Beacon with the CBAP Only ﬁeld equal to l.
  A STA might fail to receive up to dotl lMaxLostBeacons minus 1 Extended Schedule elements or DMG Beacon with the CBAP Only ﬁeld equal to 1 in consecutive beacon intervals and still may access the channel during the pseudo-static SP or CBAP. The STA shall cease transmission during a pseudo-static allocation if it fails to receive an Extended Schedule element or DMG Beacon with the CBAP Only ﬁeld equal to l for dotl lMaxLostBeacons consecutive beacon intervals.
  The PCP/AP may change the offset relative to TBTT or the duration of a pseudo-static allocation by transmitting a modiﬁed Allocation ﬁeld in an Extended Schedule element before dotl lMaxLostBeacons beacon intervals from the last transmitted Extended Schedule element. The PCP/AP may delete a pseudo- static allocation by transmitting an Extended Schedule element that does not include an allocation ﬁeld containing that allocation’s TID, source AID, and destination AID before the completion of dotllMaxLostBeacons beacon intervals from the last transmitted Extended Schedule element. In either case, the PCP/AP should not schedule a new allocation that overlaps with the previous pseudo-static allocation for a minimum of dotllMaxLostBeacons beacon intervals unless both the new and previous allocation are for a CBAP or the new allocation identiﬁes the same source DMG STA as the original pseudo-static allocation.
  To maintain the same position ofthe allocation with respect to the start ofa beacon interval, the value ofthe Allocation Block Period subﬁeld within an Allocation ﬁeld ofthe Extended Schedule element shall be set to be an integer multiple or submultiple ofthe beacon interval duration.
  Ifthe destination DMG STA ofa pseudo-static allocation receives an Extended Schedule element with an Allocation ﬁeld that indicates a change in the schedule ofthe pseudo-static allocation, the STA should enter receive state during the new pseudo-static allocation and may enter receive state during the previous allocation to account for the time it can take the source DMG STA of the allocation to receive the updated schedule.

For the purpose ot'guard tilne insertion, an allocation is deﬁned as an SP, a CBAP, and a BTI or A-BFT or ATl that is immediately followed by a CBAP allocated through the CBAP Only tield (9.33.6.3). Guard times are used to keep transmissions in adjacent allocations froln colliding.

  9.33.6.6 DMG Protected Period 9.33.6111 Introduction  Communicating STA pairs of neighboring PBSS/infrastructure BSS might be granted SPs that potentially create interference for neighbor PBSS/infrastructure BSS STA pairs. SPs within a PBSS/infrastructure BSS can also experience such interference when spatial diversity conditions change. The intent of DMG Protected Period is to minimize such interference by allowing any pair of STAs to protect their SP and thereby limit the transmission of frames during the DMG Protected period to not more than one pair of a set ofpotentially interfering pairs of communicating stations.
  A DMG Protected Period can be created by the source DMG STA during an SP, and shall be created by the source DMG STA if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  7 The source DMG STA is the PCP/AP of the BSS, the ECPAC Policy Enforced subﬁeld within the DMG Parameters ﬁeld ofthe last DMG Beacon frame transmitted by the source DMG STA is equal to l, and the Protected Period Enforced ﬁeld within the ECPAC Policy Detail ﬁeld of the last ECPAC Policy element transmitted by the source DMG STA is equal to l.
  7 The source DMG STA is not the PCP/AP of the BSS, the ECPAC Policy Enforced subﬁeld within the DMG Parameters ﬁeld ofthe last DMG Beacon frame received by the source DMG STA from the PCP/AP of the BSS is equal to l, and the Protected Period Enforced ﬁeld within the ECPAC Policy Detail ﬁeld of the last ECPAC Policy element received by the source DMG STA from the PCP/AP ofthe BSS is equal to 1.
   Both the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA of an SP are owners ofthe DMG Protected Period.
  During any DMG Protected Period, both stations can receive frames from the other participant.
  A DMG STA that creates a DMG Protected Period during an SP in which it is a source DMG STA or a destination DMG STA moves to and stays in Listening Mode during time interval that starts before the start ofthe SP and remains in the Listening mode until it is allowed to use the SP. The actual duration ofthe time the STA stays in the Listening Mode is limited by the aDMGPPMinListeningTime parameter. The intent of the Listening Mode is that the DMG STA listens to other DMG STAs that may have an SP that overlaps with the SP where the DMG STA is a source DMG STA or a destination DMG STA. The NAV mechanism is used to indicate the time occupancy and the DMG STA in the Listening Mode updates NAV timers. Ifthe NAV timers are not equal to 0, the DMG STA does not use the time ofthe SP in which it is a source DMG STA or a destination DMG STA. Ifnone of the NAV timers has a nonzero value at the start of the SP, the DMG STA is allowed to leave the Listening Mode and use the SP. Ifat least one ofthe NAV timers has a nonzero value at the start of the SP, the DMG STA is allowed to leave the Listening Mode and to use the time remaining in the SP after all NAV timers become or already have value zero.
  Listening Mode is a mode ofoperation during which a DMG STA is in receiving state and meets at least one ofthe following conditions:
   a) Its receiving antenna are in the quasi-omni mode.
  b) Its receiving antenna are directed to the peer DMG STA for which this DMG STA is either the destination or source DMG STA.
  A DMG Protected Period is established through an RTS/DMG CTS handshake. To create a DMG Protected Period, the source DMG STA of an SP sends an RTS, and the recipient STA responds with a DMG CTS. If the recipient STA responds with a DMG CTS, then a DMG Protected Period is established; otherwise, no DMG Protected Period has been established. In all cases of DMG Protected Period establishment, the same      

page 287
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  antenna conﬁgurations that are used by the STAs that establish the DMG Protected Period are used for the exchange of frames during the DMG Protected Period.
  9.33.6152 DMG Protected Period establishment and maintenance  A DMG STA that attempts to create a DMG Protected Period during an SP shall transition to Listening Mode not less than aDMGPPMinListeningTime before the attempt and shall remain in Listening Mode for at least aDMGPPMinListeningTime before making the attempt.
  A STA shall not issue an RTS to establish a DMG Protected Period if any of its NAV timers is not equal to zero.
  A DMG STA that transmits an RTS to establish a DMG Protected Period during an SP in which it is a source DMG STA shall not transmit the RTS outside ofthe SP and the value ofthe Duration ﬁeld ofthe RTS shall not exceed the duration ofthe portion of the SP that remains following the RTS transmission.
  In order to maintain STAs that are not aware of the establishment of the DMG Protected Period because they have begun listening to the medium alter the establishment of a DMG Protected Period, a STA that established a DMG Protected period should transmit additional RTSs. An additional RTS should be sent at the end of every (aDMGPPMinListeningTime r aRTSTimeontTime) interval during the DMG Protected Period iftlie duration ofthe RTS/DMG CTS exchange is less than the time remaining in the SP.
  A DMG STA that transmitted an RTS that established a DMG Protected Period sliall transmit data frames during the DMG Protected Period using the same antenna conﬁguration as was used for the transmission of the RTS.
  A DMG STA should transition to Listening Mode not less than aDMGPPMinListeningTime before the start ofan SP in which it is the destination DMG STA.
  During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP shall respond with a DMG CTS if the recipient DMG STA has been in Listening Mode for aDMGPPMinListeningTime at the start of the reception of the RTS and none of its NAV timers has a nonzero value.
  During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP shall not respond with a DMG CTS if at the start ofthe reception ofthe RTS the recipient DMG STA has a nonzero value in at least one ofits NAV timers or the recipient DMG STA has not been in Listening Mode for at least aDMGPPMinListeningTime.
  During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP may respond with a DMG DTS if at the start of the reception of the RTS the recipient DMG STA has a nonzero value in at least one ofits NAV timers.
  A DMG STA may transmit a DMG DTS after expiration ofthe aRTSTimeontTime time following the start of an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, if any ofits NAV timers has a nonzero value at that time and no RTS has been received from the source DMG STA of the SP and the DMG STA has been in Listening Mode for aDMGPPMinListeningTime immediately preceding the start of transmission of the DMG DTS. The destination DMG STA shall not transmit a DMG DTS if any portion of the DMG DTS would be transmitted outside ofthe SP.

lEEE  The value in the Duration ﬁeld of a DMG DTS shall be calculated by subtracting the DMG DTS transmission time from the NAV timer in the destination DMG STA that has the largest value at the time of the start of the transmission of the DMG DTS. Tlie NAV-DA and NAV-SA ﬁelds shall be set to the MAC addresses that identify the NAV timer in the destination DMG STA that was used to detemiine the Duration ﬁeld value ofthe DMG DTS.
  During an SP in which it is the destination DMG STA, a DMG STA that receives a valid RTS with the RA equal to the recipient DMG STA MAC address and the TA corresponding to the source DMG STA of the SP may respond with a DMG DTS if at the start of the reception oftlie RTS the recipient DMG STA has not been in Listening Mode for at least aDMGPPMinListeuingTime. The value of the Duration ﬁeld of the DMG DTS sent by the recipient DMG STA shall include the difference of aDMGPPMinListeningTime and the elapsed time since the recipient DMG STA has been in Listening Mode, and the NAV-SA and the NAV- DA ﬁelds ofthe DMG DTS shall contain the recipient DMG STA MAC address.
  A destination DMG STA that responds to an RTS with a DMG CTS or DMG DTS shall transmit the response frame a SIFS interval after the end of the received RTS. A destination DMG STA that transmits either a DMG CTS or a DMG DTS shall use the same antenna conﬁguration for the subsequent transmission of ACK frames and data frames within the SP as is used for the transmission of the DMG CTS or DMG DTS.
  The source DMG STA of an SP can send a CF-End to the destination DMG STA of the SP to truncate a DMG Protected Period. Regardless ofwhether this CF-Eud is sent, a CF-End is also sent to the PCP/AP (see 9.33.8).
  9.33.6153 NAV Update in DMG Protected Period  STAs in the Listening Mode shall update their NAV timers according to the procedures described in 9.33.10.

  When an SP terminates, either through time allocation expiration or truncation, then the source DMG STA ofthat SP may reset any NAV timer to O that has an associated variable NAViDTSCANCELABLE with a value oftrue.
  9.33.6.6.4 Interference report  A STA that receives an RTS and/or DMG CTS frame that updates the NAV and that overlaps in time with an SP where the STA is destination or source, may report the overlap to the PCP/AP by sending a DMG ADDTS Request frame variant (8.5.3.32) and including in the DMG TSPEC element (8.4.2.136) the indication of interference in tlie TSCONST ﬁeld (Figure 8-401ag). Transmission of the DMG ADDTS Request frame variant shall follow the rules deﬁned in 10.4, with the following exceptions.
  The Allocation ID ﬁeld of the DMG TSPEC element shall identify the allocation during which the interference was detected. One ADDTS Request frame is generated and transmitted for each allocation during which interference is detected.
  The TSCONST ﬁeld ofthe DMG TSPEC element may contain one or more Trafﬁc Scheduling Constraint ﬁelds. Each Trafﬁc Scheduling Constraint ﬁeld provides information separately for each overlapping NAV event. The following NAV events should be reported:
  a) Nouzero NAV at start of SP  b) Extension ofNAV during the SP, including extension ofan initial nonzero NAV and transitioning of the NAV from zero to nonzero value during the SP

  Use ofthe infomiation conveyed in the TSCONST ﬁeld is outside the scope ofthis standard.
9.33.6.7 Service period recovery  When a non-PCP/non-AP STA fails to receive the Extended Schedule element for a beacon interval, the non-PCP/non-AP STA has no knowledge oftlie nonpseudo-static SPs allocated during the beacon interval that indicate it is the source DMG STA; therefore, it fails to initiate transmission during those SPs. If the destination ofthe nonpseudo-static SP is a PCP/AP and it does not receive any frames from the source non- PCP/non-AP STA for the dotl lSPldleTimeout interval from the start of the SP, the PCP/AP may truncate the SP and use the mechanism described in 9.33.7 to reallocate the remaining duration of the SP to the source DMG STA of the SP or other STAs provided that it was a truncatable SP. If the SP is not a truncatable SP, the PCP may stay awake or may switch to Doze state. lfthe non-PCP/non-AP STA failed to receive the Extended Schedule element from the PCP/AP for that beacon interval, it may switch to Doze state or may direct its receive antenna towards the PCP/AP to receive a Grant during nonpseudo-static SPs or CBAPs in the current beacon interval.
  A PCP/AP may reclaim the entire time allocated in an SP between two non-PCP/non-AP STAs if the following two conditions are met:
   7 The SP is announced within an Extended Schedule element transmitted during the ATI.
  7 The PCP/AP does not receive a response frame from at least one of the source and destination non- PCP/non-AP STAs ofthat SP as part of the ATI exchange (9.33.3).
  In either case described in this subclause, the PCP/AP may reallocate the reclaimed SP time as a CBAP, SP, or take no further action. Otherwise, ifnone ofthese conditions apply, no time may be reclaimed.
  9.33.7 Dynamic allocation of service period 9.33.7.1 General Dynamic allocation of service period is employed to allocate channel time during scheduled SPs and   CBAPs. The procedure includes an optional Polling Period (PP) phase and a Grant Period (GP) phase.
Service periods allocated using this mechanism do not persist beyond a beacon interval. Persistent      

page 290
lEEE   allocations are created using the allocation mechanisms described in 10.4.
  The PP Available ﬁeld in the STA Availability element (8.4.2.135) indicates whether a STA participates in the PP phase of the Dynamic Allocation of Service Period mechanism. A STA that participates in PP phase ofthe Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods responds to Poll frames during the PP. A STA that participates in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods uses the time allocated through Grant frames during the GP to transmit frames. A STA may set the PP Available ﬁeld in a transmitted STA Availability element to zero to indicate that the STA does not respond to Poll frames during the PP and the GP.
  NOTEiA STA can receive a Grant frame in periods ofthe beacon interval other than the GP, in which case the STA uses the time allocated through the Grant frame. An example is described in 9.355.
  The PCP/AP shall not transmit Poll frames to a STA whose PP Available ﬁeld in the STA Availability element is 0. The PCP/AP shall not dynamically allocate a service period to a STA that is in a Doze BI (10.2.5). A PCP/AP may transmit Poll frames to a STA from which the PCP/AP has not received a STA Availability element with the PP Available ﬁeld from the STA equal to 0.
  Ifa PCP/AP wants to dynamically allocate Service Periods during a scheduled SP for which both the source and destination AID ﬁelds are set to the broadcast AID, the PCP/AP shall set the truncatable subﬁeld to one within the Allocation ﬁeld corresponding to the scheduled SP.
  If a non-PCP/non-AP STA is neither source nor an individually addressed destination during a truncatable SP and the non-PCP/non-AP STA participates in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods and the non-PCP/ non-AP STA is in an Awake BI, then the non-PCP/non-AP STA should be in the Awake state for the duration of the truncatable SP.
  A non-PCP/non-AP STA that participates in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods shall be in the Awake state for dotllMinPPDuration from the start of each truncatable SP for which both the source and the destination AID ﬁelds are set to the broadcast AID and that occurs within each Awake BI of that STA.
 Following the expiration of dot1 1MinPPDuration, the non-PCP/non-AP STA should remain in the Awake state until the end ofthe truncatable SP.
  A STA shall be in the Awake state for dotl lMinPPDuration from the start of each scheduled CBAP that occurs within each Awake BI of that STA. A STA that enters the Doze state at any time during a CBAP and then returns to the Awake state later during that same CBAP shall not transmit except in response to a reception or when an explicit Grant frame is received that gives the STA permission to transmit during the CBAP.
  As described in 9.33.8, a STA that participates in Dynamic Allocation of Service Periods and that is neither source nor destination during a truncatable SP can be in the receive state with its receive antennas conﬁgured in a quasi-omni antenna pattern for the duration ofthe truncatable SP.
  A STA that receives a Grant frame with an SP allocation for which it is either source or destination shall not transmit longer than the time granted to it.
  Any STA coordinated by an MM-SME that belongs to an MMSL cluster identiﬁed by the Source AID and Destination AID that are equal to, respectively, the Source AID and Destination AID of the Dynamic Allocation Info ﬁeld in the Grant frame may transmit during the allocation, ifthe STA sent an MMS element to the peer STA and the BeamLink Cluster ﬁeld within the MMS element is 1.
   An example of dynamic allocation of service period is shown in Figure 9-46.

  A non-PCP/non-AP STA may switch to Doze state if it does not receive a Grant frame from the PCP/AP  within dotl lMinPPDuration from the start of the scheduled SP for which the source AID and destination AID are set to the broadcast AID.
      

page 293
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  To commence the GP, the PCP/AP shall transmit Grant frames to notify the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA about a dynamically allocated service period. The PCP/AP should transmit the last Grant frame within a GP to the source of the dynamically allocated SP if the source of the dynamically allocated SP is not the PCP/AP. In each transmitted Grant frame, the PCP/AP shall set the Duration ﬁeld within the Grant frame to a time that does not overlap in time with another SP that has either the source AID or destination AID different from the broadcast AID. In addition, the source AID and destination AID ﬁelds shall be set to the source and destination, respectively, ofthe dynamically allocated SP, the AllocationType ﬁeld set to indicate the channel access mechanism during the allocation, and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld set to a value that is not greater than the result ofthe subtraction ofthe duration ofall remaining Grant frame transmissions, if any, plus all appropriate IFSs (9.3.2.3), plus 2XSIFS from the value of the Duration ﬁeld.
 An allocation that is indicated in this manner begins at the time that is equal to the PIIY-TXEND.indication of the Grant frame plus the value from the Duration ﬁeld of the Grant frame minus the value of the Allocation Duration ﬁeld ofthe Grant frame, and continues for the time indicated in the Allocation Duration ﬁeld ofthe Grant frame.
   The Dynamic Allocation Info ﬁeld within Grant frames transmitted as part ofthe same GP shall be the same.
   NOTEiThIS means the PCP/AP can create only one allocation per GP.
  During an SP between a source DMG STA and a destination DMG STA, the source DMG STA may transmit a Grant frame to the destination DMG STA to relinquish the remainder ofthe SP to the destination DMG STA. In the Allocation Info ﬁeld of the transmitted Grant frame, the source DMG STA shall set source AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe destination DMG STA, the destination AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe source DMG STA, the AllocationType ﬁeld set to indicate SP, and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld set to the time remaining in the SP minus the time taken to transmit the Grant frame. The Duration ﬁeld in the Grant frame shall be set to the value of the Allocation Duration ﬁeld. Upon transmission of the Grant frame, for the remainder the SP the roles ofsource DMG STA and destination DMG STA are swapped between the STAs.
  During a TXOP between a TXOP holder and a TXOP responder, the TXOP holder may transmit a Grant frame to the TXOP responder to relinquish the remainder of the TXOP to the TXOP responder. In the transmitted Grant frame, the TXOP holder shall set source AID ﬁeld to the AID of the TXOP responder, the destination AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe TXOP holder, the AllocationType ﬁeld set to indicate CBAP, and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld set to the time remaining in the TXOP minus the time taken to transmit the Grant frame. The Duration ﬁeld in the Grant frame shall be set to the value ofthe Allocation Duration ﬁeld. Upon transmission of the Grant frame, for the remainder the TXOP the roles of TXOP holder and TXOP responder are swapped between the STAs.
  A STA that receives a Grant frame shall not update its NAV if the value of either the source AID or destination AID ﬁelds in the Grant frame are equal to the STA’s AID.
  The PCP/AP may grant a dynamic allocation of service period to a STA that does not transmit a SPR frame during the PP.
  9.33.8 Dynamic truncation of service period  A STA truncates an SP to release the remaining time in the SP. The STA can use the CF-End frame to truncate the SP at the peer STA, to reset NAV in third party STAs and to return to the PCP/AP the time left in the SP, thus allowing the PCP/AP to grant any portion of the released time as part of an SP to any other STA or to allocate any portion of it as a CBAP. The STA can use the Grant frame to release any part of the time left in the SP as a CBAP.
  If a STA is neither source nor destination during a truncatable SP and the STA desires to participate in  Dynamic allocation of service period, the STA should be in the receive state with its receive antenna conﬁgured in a quasi-omni antenna patteni for the duration of the truncatable SP. If both the source and      

page 294
lEEE  destination AID ﬁelds ofa truncatable SP are set to the broadcast AID, a uon-PCP/uou-AP STA may direct its receive antenna to its PCP/AP for the duration ofthe truncatable SP ifthe uon-PCP/uou-AP STA does not participate in a frame exchange and the truncatable SP is not dynamically allocated to the nou-PCP/uon-AP STA.
  Only the source DMG STA of an SP may truncate the SP, except that the destination DMG STA may truncate the SP if it does not receive an expected transmission from the source DMG STA at the start ofthe SP as deﬁned in 9.33.6.7.
  In order to advertise the availability oftruncatable SP time for reuse through PCP/AP dynamic allocation, a uon-PCP/uon-AP STA shall transmit an CF-End frame to the PCP/AP. A STA is not required to truncate an SP ifa portion ofthe SP is unused.
  In order to enable CBAP access during the time released through SP truncation, the STA shall broadcast a Grant frame with the Source AID and Destination AID set to broadcast AID, the AllocationType ﬁeld set to indicate CBAP and the Duration ﬁeld set to the time needed to transmit the Grant frame(s) (the Duration ﬁeld in a Grant frame does not include duration ofthat frame) plus SIFS and plus the time needed to transmit the following CF-Eud frame and the response CF-End frame, if required and appropriate IFS (9.3.2.3) values. The Allocation Duration ﬁeld shall be set to a value that is not greater than the result of the subtraction ofthe value in the Duration ﬁeld from the time remaining in the SP. The CBAP that is indicated in this manner begins at the time that is equal to the PIIY-TXEND.iudication of the Grant frame plus the value from the Duration ﬁeld of the Grant frame and continues for the time indicated in the Allocation Duration ﬁeld ofthe Grant frame.
  The STA shall not transmit the Grant frame and shall not transmit the CF-End frame to the PCP/AP if the SP is not indicated as truncatable.
  After transmission ofthe CF-End frame to the PCP/AP or after broadcasting a Grant frame, the STA shall transmit a CF-End frame to the peer STA ofthe SP. The CF-End frame releases any time remaining in the SP at the recipient and resets the NAV in third party STAs. The NAV is reset only ifthe RA and TA ofthe CF-Eud frame match the addresses ofthe frame that established the NAV (see 9.33.10). The recipient STA may transmit a CF-End frame SIFS after the reception ifthe Duration ﬁeld ofthe received frame is not equal to 0 and the transmission does not extend beyond the end ofthe originally scheduled SP.
  A STA shall not initiate SP truncation if there is not enough time left in the SP to complete the frame exchange required for truncation of the SP.
  After the truncation is completed, the PCP/AP may dynamically allocate any portion of the relinquished channel time that has not been allocated to a CBAP through a transmitted Grant frame (9.33.7).
  9.33.9 Dynamic extension of service period  A uon-PCP/uon-AP STA uses dynamic extension of SP to extend the allocated time in the current SP. The additional time can be used to support variable bit rate traffic, for retransmi ions or for other purposes. The SPR frame is sent by a uon-PCP/uou-AP STA to the PCP/AP to request additional SP time in the current beacon interval.
     Except in response to a Poll frame from the PCP/AP, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not transmit an SPR frame within an SP ifthe current SP is not extendable (see 8.4.2.134).
   Only the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA of an SP can transmit an SPR during that SP.
  If the PCP/AP is not the source of an extendable SP, it should be in the receive state and with its receive antennas conﬁgured in a quasi-omni antenna pattern for the duration of the extendable SP.
      

page 295
IEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012   To request extension ofthe current SP, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall transmit an SPR frame to the PCP/AP.
 The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not request extension ofthe current SP ifthere is not enough time left in the SP to complete the frame exchange required for the SP extension. In the transmitted SPR frame, the STA shall set the RA ﬁeld to the address of the PCP/AP, the Duration ﬁeld to the time left in the SP [not including the SPR transmission time), and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld to the additional amount of time requested by the STA following the end ofthe current SP.
  The PCP/AP may grant the request for an extension ofan SP only ifthe following SP has the broadcast AID as both source and destination AID, and the duration of the following SP is larger than the value of the Allocation Duration ﬁeld in the received SPR frame. To grant an extension request, the PCP/AP shall transmit a Grant frame with the RA ﬁeld set to the value ofthe TA in the received SPR frame, the Duration ﬁeld set to the value ofthe Duration ﬁeld received in the SPR frame minus SIFS and minus the duration of this Grant frame transmission, and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld set to the amount ofadditional time granted by the PCP/AP.
  To decline a request for an extension ofan SP, the PCP/AP shall transmit a Grant frame with the RA ﬁeld set to the value of the TA in the received SPR frame, the Duration ﬁeld set to the value ofthe Duration ﬁeld received in the SPR frame minus SIFS and minus the duration of this Grant frame transmission, and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld set to 0.
  The extension request is successful if the non-PCP/non-AP STA receives from the PCP/AP a Grant frame with a nonzero value for the Allocation Duration ﬁeld SIFS after the SPR. SIFS after the reception of a Grant frame from the PCP/AP with a nonzero value for the Allocation Duration ﬁeld, the non-PCP/non-AP STA shall transmit a Grant frame to the partner STA ofthe SP with the Duration ﬁeld set to the value ofthe Duration ﬁeld of the Grant frame received from the PCP/AP minus the duration of this Grant frame transmission minus SIFS, and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld set to the value ofthe Allocation Duration ﬁeld ofthe Grant frame received from the PCP/AP.
  The PCP/AP shall not transmit an SPR frame ifit wants to extend an SP in which it is the source. A PCP/AP that extends an SP for which it is the source DMG STA shall transmit a Grant frame to the destination DMG STA ofthe SP to indicate the extension ofthe SP. The Duration ﬁeld in the transmitted Grant frame shall be set to the remaining time in the SP plus any additional channel time allocated by the PCP/AP following the end of the SP. The Allocation Duration ﬁeld ofthe Grant frame shall be set to the additional channel time allocated by the PCP/AP following the end ofthe SP.
  9.33.10 Updating multiple NAV timers  Ifa DMG STA supports multiple NAV timers, the number ofavailable NAV timers within the DMG STA shall be not less than aMinNAVTimersNumber. Each NAV timer is identiﬁed by a pair of MAC addresses, NAVSRC and NAVDST, and has associated variables NAV7RTSCANCELABLE and NAViDTSCANCELABLE. Each STA also maintains a variable UPDATE70PTIONAL. When a STA is enabled for operation, all NAV timers shall have NULL values for their NAVSRC and NAVDST identiﬁers, the value of NAV7RTSCANCELABLE shall be false, the value of NAViDTSCANCELABLE shall be false, and each NAV timer shall have the value 0. NAV timer address pairs correspond to the NAV-SA and NAV-DA ﬁelds in DMG DTS frames and correspond to the RA and TA ﬁelds of all other received frames that are used to update the NAV timers. Receipt of any frame can cause an update to the NAV timer whose identifying address pair corresponds to the speciﬁed address ﬁelds of the received frame according to the rules in this subclause.
  STAs receiving any valid frame shall perform the following NAV Timer update operation expressed using the following pseudocode:

iEEE  9.34 DMG PCP/AP clustering 9.34.1 General  A PCP/AP may use the PCP/AP clustering mechanism to improve spatial sharing and interference mitigation with other co-channel DMG BSSs. There are two types ofclustering:
  7 Decentralized PCP/AP clustering that involves a single S-PCP/S-AP in the BSA ofthe S-PCP/S-AP  7 Centralized PCP/AP clustering where there can be multiple S-APs in the BSA of any one S-AP, and all S-APs are coordinated via a single centralized coordination service set  PCP/AP clustering allows a PCP/AP that is a member of a cluster to schedule transmissions in nonoverlapping time periods with respect to other members of the same cluster since the PCP/AP can receive DMG Beacon and Announce frames containing the Extended Schedule element of other PCPs/APs that are members of the cluster and can also receive the Extended Schedule element from another BSS through associated non-PCP/non-AP STAs (9.34.4).
  A STA is decentralized PCP/AP clustering capable if it sets the Decentralized PCP/AP Clustering ﬁeld to 1 within the DMG PCP/AP Capability Information ﬁeld in the DMG Capabilities element. A STA is centralized PCP/AP clustering capable if it sets the Centralized PCP/AP Clustering ﬁeld to 1 within the DMG PCP/AP Capability Information ﬁeld in the DMG Capabilities element. The PCP/AP employs the Clustering Control ﬁeld and ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld deﬁned in 8.3.4.1 to conﬁgure the use of PCP/ AP Clustering. A decentralized PCP/AP clustering capable or centralized PCP/AP clustering capable PCP/ AP that transmits the Clustering Control ﬁeld is decentralized clustering enabled or centralized clustering enabled, respectively. A PCP/AP that does not transmit the Clustering Control ﬁeld is clustering disabled.
  Decentralized clustering enabled PCPs/APs operating on the same channel may fomi a decentralized PCP/ AP cluster. A PCP/AP cluster includes one S-PCP/S-AP and zero or more member PCPs/APs. The MAC address of the S-PCP/S-AP shall be the Cluster ID of the decentralized PCP/AP cluster. Centralized clustering enabled PCPs/APs operating on the same channel as a S-AP form a centralized PCP/AP cluster as described in 9.34.2.2. The Cluster ID ofthe centralized PCP/AP cluster shall be set to the MAC address of the S-AP.
  A clustering enabled PCP/AP that is not a member of any cluster shall set the Cluster Member Role subﬁeld to zero in transmitted frames that contain the Clustering Control ﬁeld.
  Each PCP/AP that is a member ofa PCP/AP cluster shall include the Clustering Control ﬁeld in each DMG Beacon it transmits.
  For each cluster, there exists a set of ClusterMaxMem Beacon SPs. The n"‘ Beacon SP, Beacon SP“, begins at ClusterTimeOffsetwl ps following the TBTT ofthe S-PCP/S-AP, where  Clusterrimeogﬁvezm : 1024 x (dot!IBeuL'anPeriod/CIuSterMaXMem) x ("71) and n=2, 3... ., ClusterMaxMem The ClusterTimeOffsetnrl and Beacon SP" where n equals one is reserved for the S-PCP/S-AP.
  A PCP/AP that is a member ofa PCP/AP cluster shall transmit its DMG Beacon frame during one of the Beacon SPs as speciﬁed in 9.34.2.
  The maximum size of the Beacon SP Duration ﬁeld transmitted by a S-PCP/S-AP shall be the beacon interval ofthe S-PCP/S-AP divided by ClusterMaxMem.

A decentralized clustering enabled PCP/ AP becomes an S-PCP/S-AP ofa decentralized PCP/AP cluster by transmitting a DMG Beacon at least once every aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced subﬁeld in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld set to 0 and that includes a Clustering Control ﬁeld with the Beacon SP duration subﬁeld set to the value of dotl lBeaconSPDuration, the Cluster ID subﬁeld set to the S-PCP/S-AP MAC address, and the Cluster Member Role subﬁeld set to the value for an S-PCP/S-AP. The value of ClusterMaxMem subﬁeld shall be chosen to keep the result of[beacon interval length/ClusterMaxMem) as an integer number of microseconds.
  A decentralized clustering enabled PCP/AP that receives a DMG Beacon frame with the ECPAC Policy Enforced subﬁeld in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld set to 0 from an S-PCP/S-AP on the channel the PCP/AP selects to establish a BSS shall monitor the channel for DMG Beacon transmissions during each Beacon SP for an interval of length at least aMinChannelTime. Beacon SPn is empty if no DMG Beacon frame is received during Beacon SPn over an interval of length aMinChannelTime. The PCP/AP shall not become a member ofthe cluster if no Beacon SP is determined to be empty during aMinChannelTime, in which case, subject to the requirements described in 9.34.2.2, then the PCP/AP may become the S-PCP/S-AP ofa new cluster, or may cease its activity on this channel and, if desired, attempt operation on a different channel.
  A decentralized clustering enabled PCP/AP that operates its BSS on a channel on which it discovered an S- PCP/S-AP within a decentralized PCP/AP cluster and at least one empty Beacon SP shall transmit its DMG Beacon during an empty Beacon SP. By transmitting its DMG Beacon during an empty Beacon SP and by setting the clustering control ﬁeld appropriately as described in 8.3.4.1, the PCP/AP becomes a member PCP/AP.
  The member PCP/AP shall select a beacon interval length that is equal to the beacon interval length ofits S- PCP/S-AP.
  The member PCP/AP shall transmit its DMG Beacon with the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to 0, the Beacon SP duration subfreld set to the value of the Beacon SP duration subﬁeld contained in the S-PCP/S- AP DMG Beacon, the Cluster ID subﬁeld set to the MAC address ofthe S-PCP/S-AP, the Cluster Member Role subﬁeld set to the member PCP/AP value, and the ClusterMaxMem subﬁeld set to the value of the ClusterMaxMem ﬁeld contained in the S-PCP/S-AP DMG Beacon.
  A PCP/AP with a value of Cluster Member Role that is not zero shall schedule a Beacon SP that is allocated for DMG Beacon transmission of other cluster member PCPs/APs within the decentralized PCP/AP cluster at each ofClusterTimeOffset", at any time the PCP/AP transmits its own DMG Beacon. The minimum size of the Beacon SP should be equal to the value of the Beacon SP duration subﬁeld within the S-PCP/S-AP DMG Beacon.
  An S-PCP/S-AP and a member PCP/AP of a decentralized PCP/AP cluster should not transmit or schedule transmissions during a Beacon SP that is not its own Beacon SP.

  Conﬁguration step  Veriﬁcation step   Once these steps have been perfonned successfully, the STA has become an S-AP.
  270   Conﬁguration step: The conﬁguration step is defined to be successful iftlie following occur:
  The STA obtains the MAC address of the CCSR; and  The STA obtains an ECPAC Policy Detail ﬁeld, beacon interval, ClusterMaxMem, Beacon SP duration, TXSS CBAP Offset, TXSS CBAP Duration, TXSS CBAP MaxMem, TSF synchronization parameters, Cluster Time Offset availability information, and a nonempty list of excluded channels for the intended operating class ofthe STA from the CCSR; and  Either the Channel Starting Frequency of the intended operating class ofthe STA is defined in Annex E to be 56.16 6112 and channel 2 is an allowed channel in the current regulatory domain and the list of excluded channels includes channel 2, or the Channel Starting Frequency of the intended operating class ofthe STA is deﬁned in Annex E to be 56.16 G112 and channel 2 is not an allowed channel in the current regulatory domain; and  The beacon interval/ClusterMaxMem is an integer number ofmicroseconds; and  At least one of beacon interval/TXSS CBAP MaxMem or TXSS CBAP MaxMem/beacon interval is an integer.
  Otherwise, the conﬁguration step is defined to be unsuccessful. If the conﬁguration step is unsuccessful, then the STA can attempt to resolve the problem or quit attempting to start a centralized PCP/AP cluster. The method by which the STA obtains the conﬁguration information from the CCSR is not deﬁned in this standard.
   Veriﬁcation step: The veriﬁcation step is deﬁned to be the following procedure:
  The centralized clustering enabled STA monitors the channel for DMG Beacon frames over an interval of at least aMinCliannelTime.
  During this monitoring period, for each distinct Cluster ID received in a DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to l in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld and Cluster Member Role set to l (S-PCP/S-AP of the cluster) or 2 [a member PCP/AP of the cluster), the centralized clustering enabled STA determines if an S-AP with a MAC address equal to the Cluster ID belongs to the same CCSS as the centralized clustering enabled STA, via i) attempting to receive an Announce frame from the S-AP that transmitted the DMG Beacon according to the channel access rules described in 9.33 in order to solicit an ECPAC Policy

  The veriﬁcation step is deﬁned to be unsuccessful if, at the end ofthe monitoring period, there are one or more received DMG Beacon frames that are from another ECPAC. Otherwise, the veriﬁcation step is deﬁned to be successful.
  If at least one DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to 1 and was sent by an S- AP/member PCP/member AP from another ECPAC is received during the monitoring period, the centralized clustering enabled STA  7 Shall cease its activity on this channel and, if desired, attempt operation on a different channel, or  7 If one of the received DMG Beacon frames was sent by an S-AP, may elect to unenroll from its current CCSS and join the cluster ofthe S-AP as a member PCP/AP.
  If at least one DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to 1 and was sent by an S- AP from the same CCSS is received during the monitoring period, the centralized clustering enabled STA may elect either to unenroll from its current CCSS and join the cluster ofthe S-AP as a member PCP/AP or to continue and become an S-AP in the CCSS.
  In order to become an S-AP in a centralized PCP/AP cluster, a centralized clustering enabled STA shall take the following actions:

  A PCP/AP that receives at least one DMG Beacon frame that has the ECPAC Policy Enforced subﬁeld in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld set to I sent by an S-AP on every channel supported by the PCP/AP in the Operating Class within the most recent aMinChannelTime may ignore DMG Beacon frames that have the ECPAC Policy Enforced subﬁeld in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld set to I sent by an S-AP for 300 X aMinChannelTime.
  NOTE7A PCP/AP within a decentralized PCP/AP cluster does not cease DMG Beacon transmission when quitting a decentralized PCP/AP cluster. Hence, data communication is unaffected while performing these procedures.
  A centralized clustering enabled PCP/AP that attempts to join the centralized PCP/AP cluster of an S-AP as a member PCP/AP shall be a STA coordinated by an MM-SME that also coordinates a second non-PCP/ non-AP STA, and shall successfully perform the following steps in order:
  7 The PCP/AP shall monitor the channel for DMG Beacon frames during each Beacon SP over an interval of length at least aMinChannelTime. A Beacon SP" is empty if no DMG Beacon frame is received during the Beacon SP" over an interval oflength aMinChannelTime.
  7 The second non-PCP/non-AP STA shall attempt to associate with the S-AP and thereby receive an Announce frame from the S-AP. The contents of the Announce frame are passed to the PCP/AP.
  7 Upon receiving an Announce frame that includes the ECPAC Policy element, the PCP/AP shall select a Cluster Time Offset index from the intersection of a) the Cluster Time Offset indices of the empty Beacon SPs with b) the indices indicated by the Available Cluster Offset Bitmap ﬁeld in the ECPAC Policy element. Ifthe intersection is empty, the PCP/AP shall select a Cluster Time Offset index of an empty Beacon SP. The selected Cluster Time Offset index is passed to the second non- PCP/non-AP STA.
  7 The second non-PCP/non-AP STA shall respond to the Announce frame with an Information Response frame that includes the Cluster Time Offset element containing the Cluster Time Offset Index set to the selected index.
  7 The PCP/AP shall operate its BSS at the selected Cluster Time Offset on the channel of the S-AP and include the PCP/AP clustering control ﬁeld in transmitted DMG Beacon frames.
  The PCP/AP shall not become a member ofthe centralized PCP/AP cluster ifno Beacon SP is determined to be empty during aMinChannelTime or ifthe second non-PCP/non-AP STA did not associate to the S-AP, in which case the PCP/AP may attempt to join the cluster of another S-AP or cease its activity on this channel and, if desired, attempt operation on a different channel.
  A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall select a beacon interval that is equal to the beacon interval of the S-AP of the cluster.
  The member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall transmit its DMG Beacon frames with the ECPAC Policy Enforced subﬁeld in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld set to l, the Beacon SP duration subﬁeld in the Clustering Control ﬁeld set to the value of the Beacon SP duration subﬁeld contained in the most recently received S-AP DMG Beacon, the Cluster ID subﬁeld set to the MAC address of the S-AP, the

  A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall include the ECPAC Policy element in (Re)Association Response, Announce, and Infomiation Response frames with the ECPAC Policy Detail, TXSS CBAP Offset, and TXSS CBAP Duration ﬁelds set to the most recently received respective ﬁeld from the S-AP ofthe cluster, the TXSS CBAP MaxMem ﬁeld set to the value ofthe TXSS CBAP MaxMem ﬁeld received from the S-AP ofthe cluster, with the CCSR ID set to the MAC address ofthe CCSR ﬁeld received from the S-AP of the cluster, and with the Available Cluster Time Offset Bitmap ﬁeld reserved.
  At any time a PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster transmits a DMG Beacon frame, the PCP/AP shall schedule a Beacon SP that reserves time for Blll transmission by other PCPs/APs within the centralized PCP/AP cluster at each in use ClusterTimeOffsetml as indicated by the most recently transmitted (if S-AP) or received (if member PCP/AP) Available Cluster Time Offset Bitmap. The minimum size ofthe Beacon SP shall be equal to the value ofthe Beacon SP duration subﬁeld within the DMG Beacon frame of the S-AP of the centralized PCP/AP cluster. An S-AP/member PCP/member AP ofa centralized PCP/AP cluster shall not transmit or schedule transmissions during a Beacon SP of another S-AP/member PCP/ member AP.
  9.34.3 Cluster maintenance 9.34.3.1 General cluster maintenance   The TBTT of the S-PCP/S-AP provides a timing reference for the Beacon SPs of the member PCPs/APs.
 Timing synchronization among the member PCPs/APs facilitates equitable sharing ofthe common medium among the member PCPs/APs. As long as a member PCP/AP periodically receives DMG Beacons from the S-PCP/S-AP, the member PCP/AP is able to maintain synchronization with the S-PCP/S-AP and hence the other member PCPs/APs.
  9.34.3.2 Decentralized PCP/AP cluster maintenance  In the case when the S-PCP/S-AP ofa decentralized PCP/AP cluster is lost, or appears to a member PCP/AP to have been lost, another PCP/AP needs to become the S-PCP/S-AP ofthe decentralized PCP/AP cluster in order to allow the remaining member PCPs/APs to maintain synchronization with the cluster. The creation ofa new S-PCP/S-AP is called S-PCP/S-AP handover. After an S-PCP/S-AP handover, the cluster might continue to function as before, except with altered membership, or the cluster might no longer exist, or there might be one or more new clusters.
  A member PCP/AP of the decentralized PCP/AP cluster shall start an S-PCP/S-AP handover if, within a time period of4><aMinBTlPeriod beacon intervals, it does not receive a DMG Beacon with the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to 0, with the value ofthe Cluster ID ﬁeld equal to the Cluster ID ofthe cluster of which the PCP/AP is a member and with the Cluster Member Role ﬁeld set to the S-PCP/S-AP value. This is the ﬁrst Cluster Monitoring Period. During the next step in the S-PCP/S-AP handover, the member PCP/AP performs another Cluster Monitoring Period. A Cluster Monitoring Period is a time period of 4XaMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals during which the PCP/AP listens for DMG Beacons while continuing to transmit DMG Beacons using its current Beacon SP“.
  NOTEiA decentralized clustering enabled PCP/AP does not cease DMG Beacon transmission during Cluster Monitoring and S-PCP’S—Al’ handover. Hence, data communication is unaffected while perfoming these procedures,  If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the member PCP/AP receives a DMG Beacon with the value of Cluster Member Role set to the S-PCP/S-AP value, the member PCP/AP shall follow the rules in 9.34.2 to become a member PCP/AP of the cluster corresponding to the detected S-PCP/S-AP or cease operation on the channel; in either case, the Cluster Monitoring Period is temiinated.
      

page 304
lEEE  If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the PCP/AP receives no DMG Beacons with the value of Cluster Member Role set to the S-PCP/S-AP value and one or more DMG Beacons with the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to 0 and with Cluster ID equal to the Cluster ID of its last S-PCP/S-AP, then at the end of the Cluster Monitoring Period the PCP/AP compares the MAC addresses ofall such received DMG Beacons with its own MAC address. If its MAC address is the lowest, the PCP/AP shall become an S-PCP/S-AP according to the rules in 9.34.2. If its MAC address is not the lowest, the PCP/AP shall perform a new Cluster Monitoring Period. Ifthe number of Cluster Monitoring Periods performed by the PCP/AP exceeds dotl1MaxNumberO{ClusteringMonitoringPeriods, the PCP/AP may cease cluster maintenance and initiate cluster formation as described in 9.34.2.
  If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the PCP/AP does not receive a DMG Beacon that contains the value of S-PCP/S-AP in the Cluster Member Role field and does not receive a DMG Beacon with the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to 0 and with Cluster ID equal to the Cluster ID of the cluster of which it is currently a member, then at the end ofthe Cluster Monitoring Period the PCP/AP may become an S-PCP/S-AP according to the rules of 9.34.2, or it may cease its activity on this channel and, if desired, attempt operation on a different channel.
  NOTEiAn assumption to allow the establishment cran S-PCP/S-AP in this case is that the PCPs’APs Cantlol hear each olller’s DMG Beacons. The rule how to decide to switch the eltanitel 01’ to establish an S-PCP/S-AP is implementation dependent,  If, during a Cluster Monitoring Period, the member PCP/AP ofa decentralized PCP/AP cluster receives no DMG Beacons from clustering enabled STAs, then the PCP/AP shall establish itself as an S-PCP/S-AP according to the rules in 9.34.2.
  If an S-PCP/S-AP of a decentralized PCP/AP cluster detects the presence of a S-PCP/S-AP of another decentralized PCP/AP cluster on the same channel, it should schedule a Beacon SP for the DMG Beacon transmission ofthe other S-PCP/S-AP ifthe MAC address ofthe other S-PCP/S-AP is lower than the MAC address ofthis S-PCP/S-AP. The S-PCP/S-AP with higher MAC address should become a member PCP/AP of the cluster corresponding to the S-PCP/S-AP with the lower MAC address according to the mles in 9.34.2.
  9.34.3.3 Centralized PCP/AP cluster maintenance A STA, while operating as an S-AP, remains stationary with respect to its local environment.
  An S-AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, upon a change ofthe Beacon SP Duration ﬁeld or the ECPAC Policy element conﬁgured by the CCSR, shall update the Clustering Control ﬁeld sent in subsequent frames and shall send individually addressed Announce or Information Response frames to other STAs within the B35 in order notify them ofthe changes.
  When a member PCP/AP is coordinated by an MM-SME and the member PCP/AP elects to change its S-AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, then a second non-PCP/non-AP STA coordinated by the MM-SME of the member PCP/AP should disassociate from the previous S-AP, and the member PCP/AP shall perform the steps described in 9.34.2.2 that allow a clustering enabled PCP/AP tojoin the centralized PCP/AP cluster ofan S-AP as a member PCP/AP.
  When a member PCP/AP is coordinated by an MM-SME and the member PCP/AP elects to change its Cluster Time Offset within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, then the member PCP/AP shall pass the updated Cluster Time Offset to a second non-PCP/non-AP STA coordinated by the MM-SME of the member PCP/ AP, and the second non-PCP/non-AP STA shall send an Information Response frame that includes a Cluster Time Offset element containing the Cluster Time Offset Index set to the updated index to the S-AP of the centralized PCP/AP cluster.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster, upon a change of the Clustering Control ﬁeld received from its S-AP, shall update the Clustering Control ﬁeld sent in subsequent frames. Upon a change ofthe ECPAC Policy Detail ﬁeld received from its S-AP, a member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster shall update the ECPAC Policy element sent in subsequent frames and send individually addressed Announce or Information Response frames to other STAs within the BSS in order notify them of the changes. The member PCP/AP within the centralized PCP/AP cluster shall attempt to receive a DMG Beacon frame from its S-AP at least once every dotl lDMGEcssPolicyDetailUpdateDurationMax TUs.
  In the case when a member PCP/AP ofa cluster has not received DMG Beacon frames from its S-AP for a duration exceeding 4><aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals, and the member PCP/AP intends to continue to operate a BSS on the channel, the PCP/AP shall either  7 Stop the current BSS then become an S-AP within the CCSS as described in 9.34.2.2; or   7 Monitor the channel for DMG Beacon frames for an interval of length at least aMinChannelTime.
During this period, if one or more DMG Beacon frames are received with the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld set to l in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld and the Cluster Member Role set to 1 [S-PCP/S- AP of cluster) from one or more S-APs, then the PCP/AP shall join a selected S-AP as a cluster member as described in 9.34.2.2. If, after the period elapses, no DMG Beacon frames are received with the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld in the DMG Parameters ﬁeld set to 1 and the Cluster Member Role set to 1 (S-PCP/S-AP of cluster) and if the PCP/AP is decentralized PCP/AP clustering capable, then the PCP/AP shall attempt to join a decentralized PCP/AP cluster if present as described in 9.34.2.1. If the PCP/AP is not decentralized PCP/AP clustering capable or a decentralized PCP/AP cluster is not present, then the PCP/AP shall set its Cluster Member Role to 0 (not currently participating in a cluster). In either case, the PCP/AP  7 Shall set the ECPAC Policy Enforced bit to 0 and shall not include the ECPAC Policy element in (Re)Association Response, Announce, or Information Response frames and  7 Should send individually addressed Announce or Information Response frames to other STAs within the BSS to notify them ofthe changes.
  9.34.3.4 Centralized PCP/AP cluster MAC requirements  If the most recent ECPAC Policy element transmitted by an S-AP/member PCP/member AP includes the BIII Enforced ﬁeld set to l, the S-AP/member PCP/member AP shall complete the BTI, A-BFT, and ATI for each subsequent beacon interval before TBTT + 8/1024XBeacon SP duration. The most recently transmitted (if an S-AP) or received (if a member PCP/member AP or non-PCP/non-AP STA) value of Beacon SP duration is used.
  If the most recent ECPAC Policy element transmitted by an S-AP/member PCP/member AP has the TXSS CBAP Enforced ﬁeld set to l, the S-AP/member PCP/member AP shall complete each of its TXSSs in the DTI within one or more TXSS CBAPs.
  If the most recent ECPAC Policy element, received by a non-PCP/non-AP STA in a BSS from the S-AP/ member PCP/member AP ofthe BSS, has the TXSS CBAP Enforced ﬁeld set to 1, then the non-PCP/non- AP STA shall perfomi each ofits TXSSs in the DTI within one or more TXSS CBAPs. Ifthe non-PCP/non- AP STA is the source DMG STA ofan SP and ifthe non-PCP/non-AP determines that it needs to perform a TXSS before continuing to transmit to the destination DMG STA ofthe SP, then the non-PCP/non-AP STA should truncate the SP (see 9.33.8).
  A TXSS CBAP shall last from TBTT + SXTXSS CBAP Offset + (n-l)><1024><beacon interval/TXSS CBAP MaxMem until TBTT + SXTXSS CBAP Offset + (n-l)><1024><beacon interval/TXSS CBAP MaxMem + SXTXSS CBAP Duration for n = l to TXSS CBAP MaxMem, excluding any time that overlaps a BIII or an SP that has source and destination DMG AIDs set to 255 (such as for a Beacon SP). The most recently transmitted (if an S-AP) or received (if a member PCP/member AP or non-PCP/non-AP STA) value of TXSS CBAP Offset and TXSS CBAP Duration ﬁelds are used.

lEEE  The TXSS CBAP is available to all STAs in an ECPAC. STAs lnay also use the TXSS CBAP for sending fralnes not related to transmit sector sweeping. Transmission rules during a TXSS CBAP are deﬁned in 9.33.5.
  NOTE7Frames, Such as data frames, sent in a szs CBAP when the szs CBAP Enforced ﬁeld is set to 1 might experience erratically higher interference than frames sent at other times due to the rxss; ofother iiearhy srAs,   Additional centralized PCP/AP cluster requirements are deﬁned in 9.33.6.6 and 10.1.3.2a.
9.34.4 Cluster report and rte-scheduling  A clustering enabled PCP/AP that receives an Extended Schedule element from another clustering enabled PCP/AP lnay re-schedule SPs and CBAPs in its beacon interval, or move the BTI (10.1.3.2a), in an attempt to mitigate any interference with the transmissions indicated in the received Extended Schedule element.
 The PCP/AP can create SPs in its beacon interval with the source and destination AID set to 255 to prevent transmissions during speciﬁc periods in the beacon interval (9.33.6.2).
  A non-PCP/non-AP STA that is a member ofa BSS and that receives a DMG Beacon should send a Cluster Report element to its PCP/AP ifthe received DMG Beacon frame meets all ofthe following conditions:
   7 The DMG Beacon is not from the STA’s PCP/AP.
  7 The DMG Beacon contains the Clustering Control ﬁeld.
7 Either  7 The value ofthe Cluster ID ﬁeld within the Clustering Control ﬁeld is different from the MAC address ofthe STA’s PCP/AP; or  7 The value of the Cluster ID ﬁeld within the Clustering Control ﬁeld is the same as the MAC address of the STA’s PCP/AP, the TBTTs of the two BSSs are less than dotl lBeaconPeriod/ [ZXClusterMemMax) apart in time, and the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld in the DMG Beacon frame received most recently froln the STA’s PCP/AP is equal to l.
  The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not send a Cluster Report element to its PCP/AP if the received DMG Beacon frame does not meet the preceding conditions.
  A Cluster Report element meeting the conditions above shall be transmitted in an Announce or Information Response frame sent to the STA’s PCP/AP. Within the transmitted Cluster Report element, the STA shall set the Cluster report subﬁeld to one. The STA shall set the Clustering Control ﬁeld within a transmitted Cluster Report element to the corresponding ﬁeld values within the Clustering Control of the received DMG Beacon, shall set the Reported BSSID ﬁeld to the BSSID of the received DMG Beacon, and shall set the Reference timestamp ﬁeld to indicate the DMG Beacon reception time. The STA shall set the Schedule present subﬁeld to one if the Extended Schedule ﬁeld is present in the transmitted Cluster Report element; otherwise, it shall set Schedule present subﬁeld to zero. The STA shall set the TSCONST present subﬁeld to one if the TSCONST ﬁeld is present in the transmitted Cluster Report element; otherwise, it shall set TSCONST present subﬁeld to zero.
  The STA shall set the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld in the Cluster Report Control ﬁeld to the value of the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld in the received DMG Beacon. The STA should attempt to receive an Announce frame from the PCP/AP that transmitted the DMG Beacon according to the channel access rules described in 9.33 in order to solicit an ECPAC Policy element. Ifthe STA obtains an ECPAC Policy element from the PCP/AP that transmitted the DMG Beacon, the STA shall set the ECPAC Policy Present subﬁeld to 1 and include the ECPAC Policy element in the transmitted Cluster Report element; otherwise, the STA shall set ECPAC Policy Present subﬁeld to 0 and not include the ECPAC Policy element in the transmitted Cluster Report elelnent. If present, the Extended Schedule Element ﬁeld within the Cluster Report element shall be set to the corresponding ﬁeld values within the Extended Schedule element of the received DMG Beacon. If present, the TSCONST ﬁeld shall be set to indicate periods oftime with respect to the TBTT of

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  the beacon interval ofthe BSS the STA participates where the transmitting STA experiences poor channel conditions, such as due to interference.
  Ifthe received DMG Beacon contains more than one Extended Schedule element entry, the STA shall repeat the aforementioned procedure and transmit a Cluster Report element corresponding to each Extended Schedule element entry.
  Upon receiving a Cluster Report element from a non-PCP/non-AP STA with the Cluster report ﬁeld set to l, a clustering enabled PCP/AP may re-schedule SPs and CBAPs in its beacon interval, move the BTI if the clustering enabled PCP/AP is an S-PCP/S-AP in a decentralized PCP/AP cluster, or change the Cluster Time Offset if the clustering enabled PCP/AP is a member PCP/AP, or perform other actions, in an attempt to mitigate any interference with the transmissions indicated in the received Cluster Report element. The clustering enabled PCP/AP may also create SPs in its beacon interval with the source and destination AID set to 255 to prevent transmissions during speciﬁc periods in the beacon interval.
  A member PCP/AP within a centralized PCP/AP cluster should report new interference infomiation and may report all interference information to the S-AP of the cluster   7 When the member PCP/AP receives one or more of the following:
  7 A DMG Beacon frame from another PCP/AP in another centralized PCP/AP cluster within the same CCSS or another CCSS  7 A Cluster Report element with the Cluster Report ﬁeld set to 1 from a non-PCP/non-AP STA within the same BSS characterizing a PCP/AP in another centralized PCP/AP cluster within the same CCSS or another CCSS; and   7 If at least dotl lDMGEcssClusterReportDurationMin TUs have elapsed since the last report.
  The report should aggregate the information received from all sources and minimize duplication. The member PCP/AP passes the report to a second non-PCP/non-AP STA coordinated by the MM-SME of the member PCP/AP, and the second non-PCP/non-AP STA sends the report in an Information Response frame that includes one or more Cluster Report elements to the S-AP of its centralized PCP/AP cluster. If the member PCP/AP does not elect to change its Cluster Time Offset at this time, the second non-PCP/non-AP STA includes a Cluster Time Offset element with an unchanged Cluster Time Offset Index ﬁeld.
  Via an unspeciﬁed means, the S-AP might aggregate received DMG Beacon frames and Cluster Report elements and send the aggregate to the CCSR. Upon receiving this information, the CCSR might reconﬁgure the TSF offsets of an S-AP, reconﬁgure the ECPAC Policy Detail of an S-AP, update the Cluster Time Offset availability infomiation provided in an individually addressed frame by an S-AP to a member PCP/ AP, or perfomi other actions.
  9.34.5 Decentralized PCP/AP cluster request  A non-PCP/non-AP STA that is a member ofa BSS may transmit a Cluster Report element to its PCP/AP to request that decentralized PCP/AP clustering be enabled in the BSS. The non-PCP/non AP STA can make this request if, for example, the device containing the non-PCP/non-AP STA intends to i alize another co- channel BSS [10.1) in which it performs the role of PCP/AP and, when performing this role, it wishes to become a member PCP/AP of the decentralized PCP/AP clustering enabled by its current PCP/AP.
     To request PCP/AP clustering to be enabled in the BSS, the STA shall transmit a Cluster Report element with the Cluster request subﬁeld set to l to its PCP/AP. Upon receiving a Cluster Report element with the Cluster request subﬁeld set to l, the PCP/AP should form and maintain decentralized PCP/AP clustering in the BSS according to the procedures described in 9.34.2 and 9.34.3. In doing that, the PCP/AP should set the minimum duration ofthe Beacon SP to be equal to the Beacon SP duration.
      

page 308
lEEE  If the non-PCP/non-AP STA does not receive a DMG Beacon frame from its PCP/AP with decentralized PCP/AP clustering enabled after dotl lClusterEnableTime following the transmission to its PCP/AP of a Cluster Report element with the Cluster request subfreld set to l, the non-PCP/non-AP STA may transmit an Announce frame including the last Extended Schedule element transmitted by the PCP/AP. If the Announce frame is transmitted, it shall use MCS 0, and the TA ﬁeld shall be set to the broadcast address. lfa DMG STA receives an Announce frame with the TA ﬁeld set to the broadcast address and with the BSSID ﬁeld different from the BSSID of its BSS, the DMG STA may send a Cluster Report element containing the Extended Schedule element within the received Announce frame to its PCP/AP, which might be used by the PCP/AP to reschedule SPs in portions of the beacon interval that are nonoverlapping in time with the SPs contained in the Extended Schedule element reported by the DMG STA.
  Ifa non-PCP/non-AP STA becomes a member PCP/AP of the clustering enabled by its current PCP/AP, the non-PCP/non-AP STA can synchronize scheduled CBAP allocations, if any, between the BSS in which it performs the role of PCP/AP and the BSS of its current PCP/AP. The non-PCP/non-AP STA can disallow STAs in the BSS in which it plays the role of PCP/AP from transmitting during the Beacon SPs of the cluster it is a part of, and this can be done by allocating an SP time-overlapping with each Beacon SP such that each allocated SP has both the source AID and destination AID ﬁelds within the Extended Schedule element set to the AID of the non-PCP/non-AP STA.
  9.35 DMG beamforming 9.35.1 General  Beamfonning (BF) is a mechanism that is used by a pair ofSTAs to achieve the necessary DMG link budget for subsequent communication. BF training is a bidirectional sequence of BF training frame transmissions that uses sector sweep and provides the necessary signaling to allow each STA to determine appropriate antenna system settings for both transmission and reception. After the successful completion of BF training, BF is said to be established. A BF training frame is an SSW frame, a DMG Beacon frame or a BRP frame.
  Figure 9-48 gives an example of the beamfomiing training procedure.

The purpose of the SLS phase is to enable colnlnunications between the two participating STAs at the control PIIY rate or higher MCS. Normally, the SLS phase provides only transmit BF training. The purpose of the BRP phase is to enable receiver training and enable iterative reﬁnement of the AWV of both transmitter and receiver at both participating STAs. If one of the participating STAs chooses to use only one transmit antenna pattenl, receive training may be performed as part ofthe SLS.
  Any BF information obtained by an initiator or a responder during a BF training attempt shall be considered invalid if either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:
 a) The SLS phase was not completed within dotl lMaxBFTime beacon intervals from the start of the SLS phase.
 b) The BRP phase, ifinitiated, was not completed within dotl lMaxBFTime beacon intervals from the start ofthe BRP phase.
  A STA shall abort an SLS if the SLS is not colnpleted within dotl lMaxBFTime beacon intervals froln the start of the SLS, and shall abort a BRP if the BRP is not completed within dotllMaxBFTime beacon intervals froln the start ofthe BRP.
  The number of sectors per DMG antenna shall not be greater than 64. The total number of sectors across all DMG antennas in a STA shall not be greater than 128.

The SLS is successful for the responder if, after the colnpletion of the SL8, the responder receives a response to a fralne translnitted to the initiator using the sector and antelma selected during the SL8.
  In this subclause, the last negotiated Total Number of Sectors ﬁeld, Nulnber of RX DMG Antennas ﬁeld, and RXSS Length field held by the initiator with respect to the responder refer to the last value for the corresponding ﬁeld received by the initiator froln the responder and that the SL3 between the initiator and responder using this value was successful for the initiator. Similarly, the last negotiated Total Number of Sectors field, Nulnber of RX DMG Antennas ﬁeld, and RXSS Length ﬁeld held by the responder with respect to the initiator refer to the last value for the corresponding ﬁeld received by the responder from the initiator and that the SL8 between the responder and initiator using this value was successful for the responder.
  Until an SLS is successful between an initiator and a responder, the last negotiated Total Nulnber ofSectors ﬁeld, Number of RX DMG Antennas ﬁeld, and RXSS Length ﬁeld used by the i 'ator with respect to the responder refer to the value of these ﬁelds in the responder’s DMG Capabilities element, and the last negotiated Total Number of Sectors ﬁeld, Number ofRX DMG Antennas field, and RXSS Length ﬁeld used by the responder with respect to the initiator refer to the value of these ﬁelds in the initiator’s DMG Capabilities element.
     If an MMSL cluster capable STA has successfully transmitted to a peer STA an MMS element with the BeamLink Cluster ﬁeld set to 1, then all MAC entities coordinated by the same MM-SME as the MMSL cluster capable STA shall use a single beamfonned link for the MMSL cluster. Also, the MAC address used

IEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  by the MMSL cluster capable STA to initiate the beamforming procedure shall remain the same until the completion ofthe beamfomiing procedure.
  9.35.2 Sector-level sweep (SLS) phase  9.35.2.1 General  The SLS phase can include as many as four components: an initiator sector sweep (ISS) to train the initiator link as described in 9.35.2.2, a responder sector sweep (RSS) to train the responder link as described in 9.35.2.3, an SSW Feedback as described in 9.35.2.4, and an SSW ACK as described in 9.35.2.5.
   An initiator shall begin the SLS phase by transmitting the frames ofthe ISS.
  A responder shall not begin transmitting the frames of an RSS before the ISS is successfully completed, except when the ISS occurs in the BTI (9.35.5).
  An initiator shall not begin an SSW Feedback before the RSS phase is successfully completed, except when the RSS occurs in the A-BFT.
  A responder shall not begin an SSW ACK with an initiator in the A-BFT. A responder shall begin an SSW ACK with an initiator immediater following the successful completion of the SSW Feedback with the initiator.
  During the SLS phase the only BF frames an initiator may transmit are the DMG Beacon frame, the SSW frame, and the SSW-Feedback frame. During the SLS phase the only BF frames a responder may transmit are the SSW frame and the SSW-ACK frame.
  If during the SLS the initiator and responder each execute a TXSS, then at the end of the SLS phase both the initiator and the responder possess their own transmit sector. If either the ISS or the RSS employs a receive sector sweep, then the responder or the initiator, respectively, possesses its own receive sector.
  The following rule applies to all channel access in DMG BSSs. A STA shall not transmit a frame as part ofa sector sweep comprising at least two sectors ifa response is expected within SIFS interval from the STA identiﬁed in the RA ﬁeld of the transmitted frame.
   A STA shall not change its transmit power during a sector sweep.
   Two examples ofthe SLS phases are shown in Figure 9-49 and Figure 9-50.
  In Figure 9-49 the initiator has many sectors, the responder has only one transmit sector and receive sector sweep is used at the responder sector sweep (the responder is transmitting all responder SSW frames through   the same transmit sector, the initiator is switching receive antennas at the same time).
  In Figure 9-50 the initiator has many transmit sectors, the responder has one transmit sector. In this case, receive training for the initiator is performed in the BRP phase.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  An initiator may employ either DMG Beacon frames or SSW frames in the ISS. Ifthe initiator begins an ISS with the transmission of a DMG Beacon frame, it shall use the DMG Beacon frame for all subsequent transmissions during the ISS. Conversely, if the initiator begins an ISS with the transmission of an SSW frame, it shall use the SSW frame for all subsequent transmissions during the ISS. A responder never begins an ISS.
  The Duration ﬁeld within each transmitted DMG Beacon frame is set to the time remaining until the end of the current BTI (see 9.35.4). The Duration ﬁeld of each transmitted SSW frame shall be set to the time remaining until the end ofthe ISS or the end ofthe current allocation, whichever is earlier.
  The initiator shall set the Direction subﬁeld in the Sector Sweep field to 0 within each DMG Beacon and SSW frame transmitted during an ISS.
  The initiator shall set the Total Sectors in ISS subﬁeld within the SSW Feedback ﬁeld to the total number of sectors that it is using in the ISS. The total is computed as the sum of all sectors employed on all antennas in the ISS multiplied by the number of the responder’s receive DMG antennas. For example, if4 sectors are used on antenna 0, 3 sectors on antenna 1, 5 sectors on antenna 2, and the responder has two receive DMG antennas, then the Total Sectors in ISS subﬁeld is set to 24.
  9.35.212 Initiator TXSS  When the IsInitiatorTXSS ﬁeld for a speciﬁc SP is l in a received Extended Schedule element (see 8.4.2.134) or Grant frame (see 8.3.1.13) and the Beamforming Training ﬁeld ofthe BF Control ﬁeld for that SP in the same Extended Schedule element or Grant frame is 1, then the SP contains an initiator TXSS, and the initiator shall start an initiator TXSS at the start of the next SP as indicated by the received Extended Schedule element or Grant frame.
   During the BTI, the initiator shall start an initiator TXSS [see also 9.35.4).
  During a CBAP, an initiator may obtain a TXOP with an initiator TXSS or may transmit a Grant frame to the responder with the Beamforming Training and IsInitiatorTXSS ﬁelds ofthe BF Control ﬁeld set to l. A responder that receives such a Grant frame in a CBAP and that has the Grant ACK Supported ﬁeld equal to 1 in the responder’s DMG Capabilities element shall respond with a Grant ACK frame SIFS interval after the reception ofthe Grant frame. In the Grant ACK frame, the responder shall set the Beamforming Training ﬁeld to l. The initiator starts the initiator TXSS SIFS interval after the reception ofthe Grant ACK frame if the Grant ACK Supported ﬁeld in the responder’s DMG Capabilities element is 1 or PIFS interval after the transmission the Grant frame otherwise. To transmit a Grant frame during a TXOP, the TXOP holder shall ﬁrst terminate the TXOP by transmitting a CF-End frame followed by the transmission of the Grant frame PIFS interval after the end ofthe last CF-End frame transmission.
  During an initiator TXSS, the Sector ID ﬁeld in each BF frame shall be set to a value that uniquely identiﬁes the transmit antenna sector employed when the BF frame is transmitted. The CDOWN ﬁeld in each transmitted frame shall contain the total number of transmissions remaining until the end of the initiator TXSS, such that the last BF frame transmission of the initiator TXSS has the CDOWN ﬁeld set to 0. Each transmitted BF frame shall be separated by a time interval equal to SBIFS, unless the allocation ends as described in 9.35.6. This is indicated in Figure 9-51.
  If the initiator has more than one DMG antenna, the initiator transmits the BF frame through a number of sectors equal to the value of the last negotiated Total Number of Sectors ﬁeld that was transmitted by the initiator to the responder. In each transmitted BF frame, the initiator shall set the Sector ID and DMG Antenna ID ﬁelds to uniquely identify the sector and the DMG Antenna ID, respectively, the initiator is using for the frame transmission and shall set the CDOWN ﬁeld to the total number of transmissions remaining from all of the initiator’s DMG antennas. The initiator shall transmit from its DMG antennas in increasing order ofAntenna ID.

Repetitions ofthe initiator sector sweep are separated by an interval equal to LBIFS time. In this case CDOWN indicates the number of sectors until the end of transmission from all initiator’s DMG antennas to all responder’s DMG antennas. At the start of an initiator TXSS, the responder should have its first receive DMG antenna conﬁgured to a quasi-omni pattem and should not change its receive antenna conﬁguration for a time corresponding to the value ofthe last negotiated Total Number of Sectors ﬁeld transmitted by the initiator multiplied by the time to transmit a single SSW frame plus appropriate IFSs (9.3.2.3). After this time, the responder may switch to a quasi-omni pattern in another DMG antenna.

  9.35.213 Initiator RXSS  An initiator RXSS may be requested only when an initiator is aware ofthe capabilities ofa responder, which includes the RXSS Length ﬁeld. An initiator can obtain the capabilities ofa responder using the Information Request and Response procedure as described in 1029.1.
  When the IsInitiatorTXSS ﬁeld for a speciﬁc SP in a received Extended Schedule element or Grant frame is 0 and the Beamforming Training ﬁeld of the BF Control ﬁeld for that SP in the same Extended Schedule element or Grant frame is 1, then the SP shall contain an i tiator RXSS, and the initiator shall start an initiator RXSS at the start of the next SP described by the received Extended Schedule element or Grant frame.
   The initiator never performs an initiator RXSS during the BTI.
  During a CBAP, an initiator shall not obtain a TXOP with an initiator RXSS. Within a CBAP, an initiator may transmit a Grant frame to the responder with the Beamfomiing Training ﬁeld set to l and the IsInitiatorTXSS ﬁeld set to 0. A responder that receives such a Grant frame in a CBAP and that has the Grant ACK Supported ﬁeld equal to 1 in the responder‘s DMG Capabilities element shall respond with a Grant ACK frame SIFS interval after the reception of the Grant frame.

The determination of which frame is received with the best quality is implementation dependent and beyond the scope ofthis standard. In addition, the initiator shall set the SNR Report ﬁeld to the SNR measured for the frame received by the sector and DMG antenna indicated by the Sector Select ﬁeld and DMG Antenna Select ﬁeld. The SSW-Feedback frame shall be transmitted through the sector identiﬁed by the value of the Sector Select ﬁeld and DMG Antenna Select ﬁeld received from the responder during the preceding responder TXSS.
  When responder RXSS was performed during the preceding RSS, the Sector Select ﬁeld and the DMG Antenna select ﬁeld in the transmitted SSW-Feedback frame are reserved. The initiator shall set the SNR Report ﬁeld to the SNR measured on the frame on the receive sector designated by the RSS.

Ifthe initiator desires to carry out the MIDC subphase as part ofthe beam reﬁnement, it shall set the BC-REQ ﬁeld to 1 to request a BC subphase and shall set the MID-REQ ﬁeld to l to request an MID subphase; in this case, the L- RX ﬁeld shall be set to indicate the number of receive AWVs the initiator uses during the MID subphase.

  9.35.2.5 Sector Sweep ACK When present, the Sector Sweep ACK [SSW ACK) occurs following an SSW Feedback.
  When a responder TXSS is performed during an RSS, the responder shall transmit an SSW-ACK frame to the initiator to perform an SSW ACK. The SSW-ACK frame shall be transmitted through the sector identiﬁed by the value of the Sector Select ﬁeld and the DMG Antenna Select ﬁeld received from the initiator in the last SSW Feedback.
  When an RXSS was performed during an RSS, an SSW-ACK frame shall be sent by the responder to the initiator. The SSW-ACK should be sent by the DMG antenna indicated in the DMG Antenna Select ﬁeld in the last SSW-Feedback frame.
  In the transmitted SSW-ACK frame, the responder shall set the TX—TRN-REQ ﬁeld to one if it requires transmitter training as part ofthe beam reﬁnement phase and shall set the L-RX ﬁeld to indicate the length of the training sequence it requests the initiator to use in the beam reﬁnement phase as described in 8.4a.4. If the responder desires to carry out a MID subphase, it sets the MID-REQ bit to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld of the SSW frame. In this case, it shall also set the L-RX ﬁeld to indicate the number of receive AWVs it uses during the MID subphase. Ifthe responder desires to carry out a BC subphase, it sets the BC-REQ bit to 1. If the initiator has set either the MID-REQ or the BC-REQ ﬁelds to 1 in the SSW-Feedback frame, the responder may set the MID-Grant or the BC-Grant ﬁelds to l, or both, to grant the requests.
  At the start of an SSW ACK, the initiator should have its receive antenna array conﬁgured to a quasi-omni antenna pattem using the DMG antenna through which it received with the highest quality during the RSS, or the best receive sector if an RXSS has been performed during the RSS, and should not change its receive antenna conﬁguration while it attempts to receive from the responder until the expected end of the SSW ACK.

IEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  9.35.3 Beam Reﬁnement Protocol (BRP) phase 9.35.3.1 General  BRP is a process in which a STA trains its RX and TX antenna array(s) and improves its TX antenna conﬁguration and RX antenna conﬁguration using an iterative procedure. BRP may be used regardless of the antenna conﬁguration a STA supports.
  The BRP phase is composed ofa BRP setup subphase, a Multiple sector ID Detection (MID) subphase, a Beam Combining (BC) subphase, a subset of the previous subphases, and one or more beam reﬁnement transactions. BRP setup allows STAs to exchange beam reﬁnement capability information and to request the execution ofthe other BRP subphases. MID and BC (collectively, the MIDC subphase) are optionally used to ﬁnd better initial AWVs for iterative beam reﬁnement than might have been found by SLS due to imperfect quasi-omni receive antenna patterns. In MID, a quasi-omni transmit pattern is tested against a number of receive AWVs; this reverses the scanning roles from the transmit sector sweep. In BC, a small set of transmit and receive AWVs are tested in pairwise combinations, thus avoiding the use of quasi-omni patterns. Finally, given the starting point from SLS or MIDC, STAs can explore a broader set of transmit and receive AWVs using a request/response exchange referred to as a beam reﬁnement transaction.
  The BRP setup subphase may be skipped if the BRP follows an SSW-ACK frame and no MID or BC snbphases were requested during the SLS. MID and BC snbphases can be skipped if either STA indicates that the subphase is not needed by setting the MID-REQ and BC-REQ ﬁelds to 0 or by setting the MID- Grant and BC-Grant ﬁelds to 0. The beam reﬁnement transaction can be skipped if both sides indicate that the transaction is not needed by setting the L-RX and TX-TRN-REQ ﬁelds to 0.
   The BRP setup phase is deﬁned in 9.35.3.2.
  The MID subphase is composed of either an R-MID subphase or an I-MID subphase or both, which are composed ofone or more transmissions of BRP-RX packets (21.10.22), followed by feedback contained in the next BRP frames from the initiator and responder.
  The BC subphase is composed of either an R-BC subphase or an I-BC subphase or both, which are composed oftransmission of BRP-RX packets to select a beam, followed by feedback.
   A beam reﬁnement transaction is a set ofBRP frames consisting ofbeam reﬁnement requests and responses.
 A beam refinement request can be either a transmit beam reﬁnement request or a receive beam reﬁnement request or both.
  A transmit beam reﬁnement request (TX-TRN-REQ ﬁeld within the BRP Request ﬁeld set to 1) indicates the need for transmit antenna array training by the transmitting STA. The BRP packet that has the TX-TRN- REQ set to l (or the next BRP packet from this STA) shall include transmit training (TRN-T) subﬁelds appended to it. The STA responding to the BRP packet shall include feedback based on measurements it performed during the reception of the BRP packet. The feedback type is dictated by the FBCK-TYPE ﬁeld within the DMG Beam Refinement element contained in the BRP packet.
  A receive beam reﬁnement request (L-RX ﬁeld within the BRP Request ﬁeld greater than zero) indicates the need of the receive antenna array training for the transmitting STA. The responding STA shall respond with a BRP packet with receive training (TRN-R) subﬁelds appended to it.
  Requests and responses can be combined in the same frame. As an example, the same frame can be both a transmit beam reﬁnement request and a receive beam reﬁnement request. The same frame can also be used as receive beam refinement response and a receive beam reﬁnement request. See the example in Figure 9-53.

Similarly, a beam reﬁnement request, if any, is separated from a preceding beam reﬁnement response by at least a SIFS interval and at most a BRPIFS interval provided sufﬁcient time is available for the complete transmission ofthe beam reﬁnement request within the allocation.
  When perfomiing BRP, if a responding STA requires longer than SIFS to transmit a BRP frame as a response for beam reﬁnement training request from a requesting STA, the responding STA should keep the IFS not longer than SIFS by transmitting one or more PPDUs to the requesting STA.
  When the beam reﬁnement occurs within the same allocation as the SLS, the SLS initiator is the beam reﬁnement initiator. If the beam reﬁnement occurs in a separate allocation, the STA that transmits the ﬁrst beam reﬁnement request is the beam reﬁnement initiator. The other STA is the beam reﬁnement responder.
  A beam reﬁnement transaction is complete when the initiator detennines that it does not need further training and it has received a BRP frame with no training requests from the beam reﬁnement responder.
  In Figure 9-53, the ﬁrst packet (from the initiator) has TX-TRN-REQ=1, the L-RX ﬁeld has a value greater than zero and TRN-T subﬁelds are appended to the packet. The second packet (from the responder) has a value greater than zero in the L-RX ﬁeld, the TX-train-response ﬁeld set to 1, the RX-train-response ﬁeld set to l, and TRN-R subﬁelds are appended to the packet. The last packet [from the initiator) has RX-train- response set to 1 and TRN-R subﬁelds are appended to the packet.
  9.35.3.2 BRP setup subphase  The BRP setup subpliase is used to exchange the intent and capabilities to conduct some or all of the subpliases and beam reﬁnement transactions in a subsequent BRP phase. The BRP setup subphase is used to set up the MIDC subphase, but can also be used to set up beam reﬁnement transactions.
  The BRP setup subphase shall be used in the following two case  7 When the RSS pan oftlie SLS phase occurred in an A-BFT, in which case the SSW-ACK frame was not part of the SLS.

  The BRP setup subphase starts with the initiator sending a BRP packet with the Capability Request subﬁeld set to l and with the remaining subﬁelds within the BRP Request ﬁeld set according to the initiator’s need for an MID subphase, a BC subphase, and a beam reﬁnement subphase. The BRP setup subphase can also start when the responder grants a MID-REQ or BC-REQ through the SSW-ACK frame or when the responder requests MID or BC in the SSW-ACK frame. Upon receiving a BRP packet with the Capability Request subﬁeld set to l, the responder shall respond with a BRP packet with the subﬁelds within the BRP Request ﬁeld set according to the responder‘s desire for an MID subphase, a BC subphase and a beam reﬁnement subphase. This process is repeated until the responder transmits to the initiator a BRP packet with the Capability Request subﬁeld set to 0 and the initiator sends as a response a BRP packet with the Capability Request subﬁeld also set to 0. The BRP packet from the initiator that initiates the termination of the BRP setup subphase can be the ﬁrst BRP packet ofthe BRP phase, either as part of beam reﬁnement or as part ofa MID or BC subphase.
  A DMG STA (either initiator or responder) requests a MID subphase with MID and BC subphases [see 9.35.632) by setting both the MID-REQ and BC-REQ subﬁelds to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld of an SSW- Feedback, SSW-ACK or BRP frame. It shall also set the L-RX subﬁeld in the BRP Request ﬁeld to the number of RX AWV settings it needs in each BRP-RX packet during the MID subphase. The peer DMG STA grants the request by setting the MID-Grant and BC-Grant subﬁelds to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld within the next SSW-ACK or BRP frame transmitted to the requesting DMG STA. Ifeither the MID or BC were not granted by the peer STA, the MID and BC subphases shall not occur.
      A DMG STA (either i tiator or responder) requests an MID only subphase [see 9.35.633) by setting the MID-REQ subﬁeld to 1 in the BRP Request ﬁeld ofan SSW-Feedback, SSW-ACK or BRP frame. The STA shall also set the L-RX subﬁeld in the BRP Request ﬁeld to the number ofRX AWV settings it needs in each BRP-RX packet during the MID-subphase. The peer DMG STA grants the request by setting the MID- Grant subﬁeld to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld within the next SSW-ACK or BRP frame transmitted to the requesting DMG STA. The Capability Request subﬁeld and request subﬁelds [TX-TRN-REQ, L-RX, MID- REQ, BC-REQ) within the granting frame shall be set to 0.
  If the MID-REQ was granted, the requesting STA shall transmit a BRP frame with the SNR Present and Sector ID Order Present subﬁelds set to l and with the Nmms ﬁeld in the FBCK-TYPE ﬁeld indicating the number of SNR measurements from the last SLS phase. In the Channel Measurement Feedback element, the requesting STA sets the SNR subﬁelds to the SNRs corresponding to the TX sectors received during the SLS phase. In the Sector ID Order subﬁeld, the requesting STA lists the sector IDs ofthe received sectors.
 The Capability Request ﬁeld within the BRP frame shall be set to 0. The MID subphase starts with the transmission ofa BRP packet from the peer STA after the reception of the list of sectors. A STA that has granted a MID only request shall not request MID or BC in the response packet. The STA may request MID or BC in the last packet it transmits to the requesting STA as part ofthe MID. The MID only subphase shall not occur if it was not granted by the peer STA.
  A DMG STA (either initiator or responder) requests a BC only subphase (see 9.35.634) by setting the BC- REQ subﬁeld to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld of an SSW-Feedback, SSW-ACK, or BRP frame. The peer DMG STA (either a responder or initiator) grants the request by setting the BC-Grant subﬁeld to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld within the next SSW-ACK or BRP frame transmitted to the requesting STA. The BC subphase shall not occur ifthe peer STA does not grant the request.
  A DMG STA indicates that beam reﬁnement transactions (9.35.641) occur by setting the L-RX ﬁeld to a value greater than 0 to indicate the need for receive beam reﬁnement or by setting the value ofthe TX-TRN- REQ ﬁeld to 1 to indicate the need for transmit beam reﬁnement or by setting both. The beam reﬁnement transactions shall occur ifat least one ofthese conditions is met.

  Ifthe responder has requested an MID subphase by setting the MID-REQ subﬁeld or the BC-REQ subﬁeld to l and the initiator rejected by setting in the response the MID-Grant or the BC-Grant subﬁelds to 0, the initiator should send a BRP frame with the Capability Request subﬁeld set to l. The responder shall respond with a BRP frame with the MID-REQ ﬁeld set to 0 and the L-RX ﬁeld set to indicate the number of TRN-R ﬁelds the responder requests for use in the BRP transaction.
  Beam reﬁnement transactions shall occur following a MIDC subphase when one or both of the following conditions are met at the last BRP frame transmitted by either the initiator or responder as part of the MID or BC subphases:
   a) Either the initiator or the responder set the L-RX ﬁeld to a value greater than 0.
   b) Either the initiator or responder has set the value ofthe TX-TRN-REQ ﬁeld to 1.
  If within the appropriate IFS the initiator does not receive a response from the responder to a packet transmitted to the responder, the initiator may retransmit the packet.
  After the BRP setup subphase, beamforming training shall immediately continue to the next phase (i.e., either MIDC subphase or the beam reﬁnement transactions). Examples of BRP setup subphase procedures are illustrated in Figure 9-54, Figure 9-55, Figure 9-59, Figure 9-60, and Figure 9-66.

The PCP/AP does not transmit SSW frames in the BTI (9.35.211).
  The PCP/AP may fragment the initiator TXSS over multiple consecutive BTIs by not transmitting a DMG Beacon frame through all sectors available to the PCP/AF in a single BTI. In a BTI with a fragmented initiator TXSS, the PCP/AF shall transmit DMG Beacon frames with the Fragmented TXSS ﬁeld set to 1.
 Otherwise, the PCP/AP shall set the Fragmented TXSS ﬁeld to zero. The PCP/AP shall not change the duration of the next BTI ifat least one of the DMG Beacon frames transmitted in the current BTI have the Fragmented TXSS ﬁeld set to l. The CDOWN ﬁeld shall be set to the total number of transmissions remaining to the end of the i tiator TXSS, such that the last DMG Beacon frame transmission of the initiator TXSS has the CDOWN ﬁeld set to 0 (i.e., in a fragmented TXSS, the value of the CDOWN ﬁeld covers the total number oftransmissions remaining in the fragmented TXSS). The TXSS Span ﬁeld shall be set to the total number of beacon intervals it takes the PCP/AF to complete the entire TXSS phase. The Duration ﬁeld within each transmitted DMG Beacon shall be set to the time remaining until the end of the current BTI.
     When a PCP/AP has more than one DMG antenna, the TXSS shall cover all the sectors in all DMG antennas. The TXSS Span ﬁeld indicates the total number of beacon intervals it takes the PCP/AP to cover all sectors in all DMG antennas. The value of the TXSS Span ﬁeld shall be lower than dotl lMaximalSectorScan. The PCP/AP shall not change DMG antennas within a BTI. The PCP/AP has a regular schedule oftransmitting through each DMG antenna (see 9.35.5.4).

IEEE  9.35.5 Beamforming in A-BFT 9.35.5.1 Allocation of A-BFT  The PCP/AP shall allocate an A-BFT period MBIFS time following the end of a BTI that included a DMG Beacon frame transmission with Next A-BFT equal to 0.
  Following the end ofa BTI, the PCP/AP shall decrement the value ofthe Next A-BFT ﬁeld by one provided it is not equal to zero and shall announce this value in the next BTI. When the Next A-BFT ﬁeld in a transmitted DMG Beacon is equal to 0, the value of the A-BFT Length ﬁeld is no less than aMinSSSlotsPerABFT as described in 9.35.5.2. The PCP/AP may increase the Next A-BFT ﬁeld value following a BTI in which the Next A-BFT ﬁeld was equal to zero. A STA shall consider that a BTI is completed at the expiration ofthe value within the Duration ﬁeld of the last DMG Beacon frame received in that BTI.
  All DMG Beacon frames transmitted within the number of beacon intervals speciﬁed within the most recently updated TXSS Span ﬁeld have the same value for all the subﬁelds within the Beacon Interval Control ﬁeld [10.1.3.2a).
  9.35.5.2 Operation during the A-BFT  Beamforming training in the A-BFT consists of the RSS and SSW Feedback of the SLS between the PCP/ AP and a STA.
   In the A-BFT, the PCP/AP is the initiator and the STA is the responder in the RSS part of the SLS (9.35.2.3).
 The BRP phase shall not be performed within the A-BFT. A STA shall not transmit in the A-BFT of a beacon interval ifit does not receive at least one DMG Beacon frame during the BTI of that beacon interval.
  A DMG STA that receives a DMG Beacon frame with the Discovery Mode ﬁeld equal to 1 and the CC Present ﬁeld equal to 1 may transmit in the A-BFT following the BTI where the DMG Beacon frame is received if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  The STA’s MAC address is equal to the value ofthe A-BFT Responder Address subﬁeld within the DMG Beacon.
  The value ofthe A-BFT Responder Address subﬁeld within the DMG Beacon is a group address of a group to which the STA belongs.
  If none of these conditions is met following the reception of the DMG Beacon frame with the Discovery Mode ﬁeld equal to l and the CC Present ﬁeld equal to I, the DMG STA shall not transmit in the A-BFT.
  The A-BFT is slotted and the length ofthe A-BFT is an integral multiple ofthe sector sweep slot time. The structure ofthe A-BFT is shown in Figure 9-56. The PCP/AP shall announce the size ofthe A-BFT in the A- BFT Length subﬁeld of the Beacon Interval Control ﬁeld (8.3.4.1), which shall be no less than aMinSSSlotsPerABFT sector sweep (SSW) slots. The ﬁrst SSW slot begins at the start ofthe A-BFT, and the following SSW slots are adjacent and nonoverlapping. An SSW slot (Figure 9-57) is a period of time within the A-BFT that can be used by a responder to transmit at least one SSW frame. An SSW slot has a duration ofaSSSlotTime. aSSSlotTime is deﬁned to be  aSSSlotTime = aAirPropagationTime + aSSDuration + MBIFS + aSSFBDuration + MBIFS The parameter aAirPropagationTime accounts for the propagation delay between the initiator and the responder. The parameter aSSDuration (10.38) provides time for a responder to transmit up to the number of  SSW frames announced in the FSS subﬁeld of the Beacon Interval Control ﬁeld in the DMG Beacon. The initiator shall set the FSS subﬁeld ofthe Beacon Interval Control ﬁeld in the DMG Beacon to a value that is

The responder shall decrement the backoff count by one at the end ofeach SSW slot, even ifthe CS function at the responder indicates the medium busy condition for that SSW slot. The responder may initiate the RSS only at the start ofthe SSW slot for which the backoff count is 0 at the beginning ofthe SSW slot.
  The responder shall transmit no more SSW frames within an SSW slot than indicated in the value ofthe FSS snbﬁeld in the DMG Beacon. If the responder has more SSW frames to transmit as part ofthe RSS, but is not allowed to send any more SSW frames in the current SSW slot, then the responder may resume the RSS at the start of the following SSW slot provided that the A-BFT has not ended. If the responder cannot complete the RSS before the end of the A-BFT, it may use the same backoff procedure described above to resume the RSS at the next A-BFT for which the value of the lsResponderTXSS ﬁeld is the same as the current A-BFT.
  The initiator shall initiate an SSW Feedback to a responder (9.35.2.4) at a time such that the beginning ofthe ﬁrst symbol ofthe SSW-Feedback frame on the air occurs at aSSFBDuration + MBIFS before the end ofthe SSW slot. A responder that transmitted at least one SSW frame within a SSW slot shall be in quasi-omni receive mode for a period of aSSFBDuration ending MBIFS time before the end of the SSW slot. The initiator may initiate an SSW Feedback to the responder at an SSW slot even if the responder did not complete RSS within that SSW slot. lfthe initiator transmits an SSW-Feedback under this circumstance, it can transmit an Announce frame to the responder in an ATI. Following the reception of the Announce frame, the responder can respond with an SPR frame requesting time for the responder to continue with the RSS. Alternatively, the responder can transmit an SPR frame to the PCP/AP in accordance with the channel access rules.
  The information contained in an SSW-Feedback frame is based on the SSW frames received during the SSW slot in which the SSW-Feedback frame was transmitted. To communicate with each other following an SLS, an initiator and responder should use the information contained within the SSW-Feedback frame that had the highest value for the SNR Report field and was transmitted or received, respectively, as part of the most recent SLS between the initiator and responder.
  A responder that receives an SSW-Feedback frame from the initiator during an A-BFT that was allocated with a DMG Beacon frame with Discovery Mode equal to 1 should not attempt to access the following aMaxABFTAccessPeriod A-BFT allocations to redo beamforming with the initiator, unless in the BTI preceding the A-BFT the responder receives a DMG Beacon frame that has the Discovery Mode field equal to l, the CC Present ﬁeld equal to l and the value of the A-BFT Responder Addres subﬁeld equal to the responder’s MAC address. This allows other STAs the opportunity to successfully contend for A-BFT access and perform beamfomiing with the initiator.
  The responder may attempt to restart the RSS within the same A-BFT ifit does not receive a SSW-Feedback frame from the initiator by the end ofthe SSW slot in which it completes the RSS. To do this, the responder shall invoke the random backoff procedure beginning at the start of the SSW slot following the completion of the RSS. The responder shall select a backoff count as a random integer drawn from a uniform distribution [0, A-BFT Length), i.e., 0 to A-BFT Length 7 l, where A-BFT Length is the value ofthe A-BFT Length field in the last received DMG Beacon. The responder shall decrement the backoff count by one at the end of each SSW slot, even ifthe CS function at the responder indicates the medium busy condition for that SSW slot. The responder may restart the RSS at the start ofthe SSW slot for which the backoff count is 0 at the beginning ofthe SSW slot provided the A-BFT still has SSW slots available.
  At the end of an A-BFT the responder shall cancel a backoff procedure that was started during the A-BFT,  but has not been completed at the end of the A-BFT. As described above, the responder invokes a random backoffprocedure at the start of each A-BFT.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  Each STA maintains a counter, FailedRSSAttempts, of the consecutive number of times the STA initiates RSS during A-BFTs but does not successfully receive an SSW-Feedback frame as a response. If FailedRSSAttempts exceeds dotl lRSSRetryLimit, the STA shall select a backoff count as a random integer drawn from a uniform distribution [0, dotllRSSBackoff), i.e., 0 inclusive through dotllRSSBackoff exclusive. The responder shall decrement the backoff count by one at the end of each A-BFT period in the following beacon intervals. The responder may re-initiate RSS only during an A-BFT when the backoff count becomes zero. The STA shall set FailedRSSAttempts to 0 upon successfully receiving an SSW- Feedback frame during the A-BFT.
      In an A-BFT, the responder shall not i tiate SSW ACK (9.35.2.5) in response to the reception ofa SSW- Feedback frame from the initiator. The SSW ACK only occurs within the DTI of a beacon interval (9.35.5.2).
  If the PCP/AP receives an SSW frame from the responder during the RSS with the Poll Required ﬁeld within the SSW frame equal to l and the TDDTI ﬁeld within the PCP/AP’s DMG Capabilities element is l, the PCP/AP shall allocate time for the responder and the PCP/AP to communicate during the ATI or within an SP ofthe DTI ofat least one ofthe following aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals beginning with the beacon interval in which the SSW frame was received. This can be done through the Extended Schedule element or the transmission of a Poll or Grant frame addressed to the responder, and the allocated time can be used for at least one ofassociation, authentication, and service period request.
  After transmitting an SSW-Feedback frame to the responder, the initiator shall send a BRP frame with the Capability Request subﬁeld within the BRP Request ﬁeld set to l and addressed to the responder. The BRP frame shall be sent in one of the following aMinBTlPeriod beacon intervals beginning with the beacon interval in which the RSS phase with the responder was last completed. The BRP frame shall be transmitted at MCS 0 using the sector identiﬁed by the Sector Select ﬁeld received from the responder during the RSS.
  In an ATI after the completion of the SSW Feedback, a responder should have its receive antenna conﬁgured to a quasi-omni antenna pattern in the DMG antenna in which it received the best sector from the initiator during the preceding ISS in order to receive an Announce, Grant, or BRP frame [with the Capability Request subﬁeld within the BRP Request ﬁeld set to 1) from the initiator, while the initiator should conﬁgure its transmit DMG antenna to the value of the Sector Select and the DMG Antenna Select ﬁelds received from the responder during the preceding RSS. If the responder does not receive an Announce or Grant frame from the initiator with the RA address equal to the responder’s MAC address until aMinBTlPeriod beacon intervals after the beacon interval in which the SLS phase with the initiator was last attempted, it may retry BF with the initiator in the A-BFT.
  Due to the multiple access nature of RSS in the A-BFT, the PCP/AP might not receive the best sector for communication with the STA. The PCP/AP may schedule an SP to perform BF again with the STA to ﬁnd the best sector for communication with the STA.
  9.35.5.3 STA Beamforming after A-BFT  The initiator shall either initiate BRP execution with the responder in the next CBAP or shall schedule time in the DTI for BRP execution with the responder if the initiator needs BRP training or the responder indicated a need for training [by setting any ofthe L-RX, TX-TRN-REQ, MlD-REQ, or BC-REQ ﬁelds to a nonzero value) as a response to an SSW-Feedback or BRP frame with Capability Request subﬁeld within the BRP Request ﬁeld set to l.
  The responder may initiate BRP in a CBAP by sending a BRP frame with any ofthe training request ﬁelds (i.e., L-RX, TX-TRN-REQ, MID-REQ, BC-REQ) set to 1.
  To schedule time in the DTI for BRP execution with the responder, the initiator shall transmit a Grant frame to the responder in one ofthe following aMinBTIPeriod beacon intervals beginning with the beacon interval

lEEE  in which the SL5 phase with the responder was last completed. In the Grant frame, the initiator shall set the RA ﬁeld to the MAC address of the responder and the TA ﬁeld to the MAC address of the initiator. In the Dynamic Allocation Info ﬁeld of the Grant frame, the AllocationType ﬁeld shall be set to indicate SP, the source AID ﬁeld shall be set to the AID ofthe initiator, the destination AID ﬁeld shall be set to the broadcast AID and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld shall be set to the expected duration ofthe BRP phase.
  If the initiator receives at least one SSW frame from a responder within an A-BFT but did not transmit an SSW-Feedback frame to the responder within that A-BFT, the initiator may schedule time in the DTI for the responder to complete the RSS. To do that, the initiator shall transmit a Grant frame to the responder before the next A-BFT. In the Grant frame, the initiator shall set the RA ﬁeld to the MAC address of the responder and the TA ﬁeld to the MAC address of the initiator. In the Dynamic Allocation Info ﬁeld of the Grant frame, the AllocationType ﬁeld shall be set to indicate SP, the source AID ﬁeld shall be set to the broadcast AID, the destination AID ﬁeld shall be set to the AID of the initiator and the Allocation Duration ﬁeld shall be set to cover for at least the remaining duration ofthe RSS.
  The initiator may transmit an Announce frame to the responder during the ATI to announce a CBAP allocation in the beacon interval. Ifthe responder receives the Announce frame with a CBAP allocation, the responder may contend for a TXOP during a CBAP to perfomi the BRP execution with the initiator or continue the RSS with the initiator.
  Any Announce or Grant frames the initiator sends to a responder after initiating beamfonning with the responder in the A-BFT but before beamforming with the responder is completed shall be transmitted at MCS 0 using the sector identiﬁed by the Sector Select ﬁeld received from the responder in the RSS.
   The execution ofthe beamfomiing procedure in an allocation in the DTI is described in 9.35.6.
9.35.5.4 Beamforming in A-BFT with multiple DMG antennas  A PCP/AP shall receive through a quasi-omni antenna pattern from a single DMG antenna throughout an A- BFT unless RXSS is used in the A-BFT, in which case it switches through antenna pattenis as described in 9.35.5.2.
  A PCP/AP shall have an A-BFT every k beacon intervals, where k is the value indicated by the N BIs A-BFT subﬁeld in the Beacon Interval Control ﬁeld. In an A-BFT, the PCP/AP shall receive in a quasi-omni antenna pattern using the DMG antenna indicated by the value of the DMG Antenna ID subﬁeld within the SSW ﬁeld transmitted in the DMG Beacon. A PCP/AP with multiple DMG antennas has a regular schedule of receiving through each DMG antenna corresponding to the DMG antenna in which a DMG Beacon is transmitted through. The PCP/AP shall switch RX DMG antenna every lallocations, where I is the value of the N A-BFT in Ant subﬁeld within the Beacon Interval Control ﬁeld.
  In each DMG Beacon, the A-BFT Count subﬁeld in the Beacon Interval Control ﬁeld indicates the number ofA-BFTs that have passed since the PCP/AP last switched RX DMG antennas.
  9.35.6 Beamiorming in DTI 9.35.6.1 General  An initiator and responder may perform BF training in the DTI within an SP allocation or within a TXOP allocation.
  An initiator shall determine the capabilities of the responder prior to initiating BF training with the  responder if the responder is associated. A STA may obtain the capabilities of other STAs through the Information Request and Infomiation Response frames (1029.1) or following a STA’s association with the

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  PBSS/infrastructure BSS. The initiator should use its own capabilities and the capabilities of the responder to compute the required allocation size to perform BF training and BF training related timeouts.
  An initiator may request the PCP/AP to schedule an SP to perform BF training with a responder by setting the Beamforming Training subﬁeld in the BF Control ﬁeld ofthe DMG TSPEC element or SPR frame to l.
 The PCP/AP shall set the Beamfomiing Training subﬁeld to 1 in the Allocation ﬁeld of the Extended Schedule element ifthe Beamfomiing Training subﬁeld in the BF Control ﬁeld ofthe DMG TSPEC element or SPR frame that generated this Allocation ﬁeld is equal to l. The PCP/AP should set the Beamfonning Training subﬁeld in an Allocation ﬁeld ofthe Extended Schedule element to 0 ifthis subﬁeld was equal to 1 when the allocation was last transmitted by the PCP/AP in an Extended Schedule element and if, since that last transmission, the PCP/AP did not receive a DMG TSPEC element for this allocation with the Beamforming Training subﬁeld equal to l.
  9.35.6.2 SLS phase execution For BF training in the DTI, both the initiator and responder shall use the SSW frame for the ISS and RSS.
  The initiator shall begin an ISS (9.35.2.2) at the start ofthe allocation with an initiator TXSS, except when the allocation is an SP and the IslnitiatorTXSS ﬁeld for this SP is equal to 0 in which case the initiator shall begin an ISS with an initiator RXSS.
  If the initiator begins the SLS within a CBAP and the responder has more than one DMG antenna, the initiator shall repeat its ISS k+l times, where k is the value indicated by the responder in the last negotiated Number ofRX DMG Antennas ﬁeld transmitted by the responder. Repetitions ofthe ISS are separated by an interval equal to LBIFS. The value ofthe CDOWN ﬁeld within SSW frames transmitted in the ISS indicates the number of sectors until the end of transmissions from all of the initiator’s DMG antennas to all of the responder’s DMG antennas.
  The RSS is a TXSS unless the allocation is an SP and the IsResponderTXSS ﬁeld for this SP is equal to 0 or the allocation is a TXOP and the RXSS Length ﬁeld within the SSW frame received by the responder during the ISS and used to obtain the TXOP is equal to a nonzero value. The responder shall begin an RSS (9.35.2.3) MBIFS time following the completion ofan ISS, provided there is sufﬁcient time in the allocation for the responder to transmit an SSW frame and the responder received an SSW frame from the initiator during the ISS.
  The initiator may restart the ISS up to dotl lBFRetryLimit times if it does not receive an SSW frame from the responder in dotl lBFTXSSTime time following the end of the ISS. The initiator shall restart the ISS SIFS time following dotl lBFTXSSTime time, provided there is sufﬁcient time left in the allocation for the initiator to transmit an SSW frame. Ifthere is not sufﬁcient time left in the allocation for the transmission of an SSW frame, the initiator shall restart the ISS at the start ofthe following allocation between the initiator and the responder.
  The initiator shall begin an SSW Feedback (9.35.2.4) MBIFS time following the completion of an RSS, provided the initiator received an SSW frame from the responder during the RSS and there is sufﬁcient time left in the allocation to complete the SSW Feedback followed by an SSW ACK (9.35.2.5) from the responder in SIFS time. If there is not sufﬁcient time left in the allocation for the completion of the SSW Feedback and SSW ACK, the initiator shall begin the SSW Feedback at the start ofthe following allocation between the initiator and the responder.
  The responder shall begin an SSW ACK (9.35.2.5) to the initiator in MBIFS time following the reception of a SSW-Feedback frame from the initiator.
  The initiator may restart the SSW Feedback up to dotl lBFRetryLimit times ifit does not receive an SSW- ACK frame from the responder in MBIFS time following the completion of the SSW Feedback. The      

page 330
lEEE  initiator shall restart the SSW Feedback PIFS time following the expected end of the SSW ACK by the responder, provided there is sufﬁcient time left in the allocation for the initiator to begin the SSW Feedback followed by an SSW ACK from the responder in SIFS time. If there is not sufﬁcient time left in the allocation for the completion of the SSW Feedback and SSW ACK, the initiator shall restart the SSW Feedback at the start ofthe following allocation between the initiator and the responder.
  Once started, the initiator and responder shall complete the SLS phase before any additional frame exchange takes place between these STAs.
  9.35.6.3 MIDC (multiple sector ID capture) subphase 9.35.6.3.1 General  In practice, the quasi-omni RX antenna pattems used in the SLS phase might exhibit imperfections that lead to an incorrect choice of the best TX sector and consequently a sub-optimal starting point for beam reﬁnement in the BRP phase. To remedy this, a multiple sector ID capture (MIDC) phase may be used.
 Instead of selecting the starting point for the beam reﬁnement transactions (i.e., the best TX sector) based on infomiation obtained with quasi-omni RX antenna patterns from the SLS phase, the MIDC subphase enables the use of additional information based on the trial of multiple TX and RX sectors.
  The MIDC subphase can be implemented in two ways. The ﬁrst option is to conduct a trial between a small set ofTX and RX AWV settings with wide (e.g., quasi-omni) antenna patterns. The second option is to carry out a trial between a small set of TX sectors and a set of RX AWV settings, chosen by the receiver in an implementation-dependent manner, that maximizes the probability ot'detemiining the RX AWVs that best match the chosen set of TX sectors. Note that this may involve using a set ofRX AWVs that correspond to the “full set" ofRX sectors (from the SLS phase). The set of TX sectors are chosen from a TX sector sweep with a quasi-omni RX antenna patteni. With either option, the end result from the MIDC subphase can be the better starting point TX and RX sector pair for further beam reﬁnement.
  For the ﬁrst option above, the MIDC subphase consi s of a MID subphase and a BC subphase. This is further elaborated upon in 9.35.632, and a sample time allocation is illustrated in Figure 9-58. For the second option, the MIDC subphase con only of a MID subphase. This s further elaborated upon in 9.35.633, and a sample time allocation is illustrated in Figure 9-59.

 This subphase enables the two DMG STAs involved to negotiate whether and how the MIDC subphase is carried out. Examples of how the MIDC subphase is set up, depending on whether beamforming is initiated in the BTI and A-BFT or in the DTI, are illustrated in Figure 9-60 and Figure 9-6], respectively.

lEEE  9.35.632 MIDC subphase with MID and BC subphases  The MIDC subphase can be implemented such that small subsets of TX Sector IDs and RX AWVs are ﬁrst chosen, followed by trials between these subsets to determine the optimal starting TX Sector ID and RX AWV pair. The set of TX sectors is chosen from an a priori TX sector sweep with a quasi-onmi RX antenna pattern (in the SL5 phase). To enable the selection of the RX sectors, and the subsequent trial between the TX and RX sectors, the MIDC subphase consists of an MID subphase and a BC (or beam combining) subphase. In the MID subphase, a wide TX beam (e.g., quasi-onini) is used while the receiver sweeps through its choice ofva settings to determine the set of RX AWVs with the highest link quality. This is  followed by the BC subphase, which involves testing the multiple RX AWVs together with multiple TX AWVs.
  This is conceptually illustrated in Figure 9-62. Note that the consecutive numbering ot‘TX Sector IDs (e.g., TX Sector IDl, TX Sector ID2, ...) or RX AWVs is just used for representation purposes. It is used to indicate the subset of TX Sector IDs without placing any restrictions on how these Sector IDs are selected (i.e., consecutive numbering of TX Sector IDs does not mean that the selected TX Sector IDs should be those that are consecutively numbered).

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND  8)  b)  lEEE Std 802.11ad-2012  Setting up the MID and BC subphases: To request a MIDC subphase with the MID and the BC subphases, the initiator shall transmit an SSW-Feedback or BRP frame with the MID-REQ and the BC-REQ ﬁelds set to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld. The responder may grant this request by setting the MID-Grant and the BC-Grant ﬁelds to 1 in the BRP Request ﬁeld within the next SSW-ACK or BRP frame transmitted to the initiator. The R-MID and R-BC subphases are performed ifthe request is granted and are not performed otherwise.
  The responder shall transmit an SSW-ACK or BRP frame to request a MIDC subphase, with the I- MID and l-BC subphases. It shall do so by setting the MID-REQ and the BC-REQ ﬁelds to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld within the transmitted frame. The initiator may grant this request by setting the MID-Grant and the BC-Grant ﬁelds to l in the BRP Request ﬁeld within the next BRP frame transmitted to the responder. The l-MID and l-BC subphases are perfomied ifthe request is granted and are not perfomied otherwise.
  If all of R-MID, R-BC, I-MID, and I-BC subphases are performed, the MID subphases are perfomied before the BC subphases. Within the MID subphase, R-MID is perfomied before I-MID.
  Within the BC subphase, R-BC is performed before I-BC (see Figure 9-58 and Figure 9-59).
  In addition to the MID-REQ, BC-REQ, MID-Grant and BC-Grant ﬁelds, the responder (and/or initiator) needs to obtain the number of RX AWV settings to be appended to BRP-RX packets in the R/I-MID subphase. To do this, the initiator (and/or responder) should use the L-RX ﬁeld in the BRP Request ﬁeld to convey this infomiation. Similarly, the responder (and/or initiator) needs to obtain the IDs and SNRs of the TX sectors received during the SL5 phase for use in the R-BC and I-BC subphases. To do this, the responder [and/or initiator) shall send a BRP packet with the TXSS- FBCK-REQ subﬁeld and SNR Requested subﬁeld set to l in the FBCK-REQ ﬁeld of the DMG Beam Reﬁnement element. In response, the initiator (and/or responder) should send a BRP frame with both the SNR Present subﬁeld and the Sector ID Order Present subﬁeld set to l. The NW," subﬁeld in the FBCK—TYPE ﬁeld is set to indicate the number of sectors received during the last SLS for which an SNR measurement is included. In the Channel Measurement ﬁeld, the initiator (or responder) should set the SNR subﬁeld to the SNRs corresponding to the TX sectors trialed during the SL5 phase. In the Sector ID subﬁeld, it should list the sector IDs of the received sectors. The responder (and/or initiator) should then use the SNR information, and any additional information such as angular separation between sectors, to determine the TX sectors for use in the BC subphase.
 The responder (or initiator) shall inform the initiator (or responder) of the number of TX sectors using the MW”, subﬁeld in the FBCK—TYPE ﬁeld during the BRP setup subphase. After the R/I- MID subphases, the same ﬁeld is used to exchange infomiation about the number ofRX AWVs to be trialed during the BC subphase.
  Executing the MID subphase: If R-MID was requested and granted during the SL8 and/or subsequent BRP setup subphase, then after the BRP setup subphase, the R-MID shall be initiated by the responder sending a BRP frame with TRN-R ﬁelds (as requested in the BRP setup subphase).
 This packet may be transmitted using a wide pattern, approaching an omni transmit pattern, or using a sector antenna pattern. The receiver may use the TRN-R ﬁelds for receiver training.
  Ifthe MID Extension ﬁeld in the packet is equal to l, the responder shall transmit another BRP-RX packet, which may be transmitted using another transmit patteni. It may continue transmitting BRP- RX packets as long as the MID Extension ﬁeld in all ofthem is equal to l. The last BRP-RX packet transmitted by the responder shall have the MID Extension ﬁeld set to 0.
  Ifthe initiator does not receive a BRP-RX packet within BRPIFS after transmitting the last packet of the BRP setup subphase, it may retransmit the last packet of the BRP setup subphase.
  After the initiator receives a BRP-RX packet with the MID Extension ﬁeld set to 0, it shall respond with a BRP frame with the appropriate feedback. This BRP frame should be sent using the best TX sector as detemiined in the SL5 phase, while the responder should use a quasi-omni pattern to receive this frame. The feedback included in this BRP frame is the number ofRX AWVs to be tested in the subsequent R-BC subphase using the NM”), subﬁeld in the FBCK-TYPE ﬁeld.
      

page 334
IEEE  Std 802.11ad-2012  0)  304    IfI-MID was granted in addition to R-MID, the initiator shall send a BRP frame with TRN-R ﬁelds (as requested in the BRP setup subphase). The initiator shall continue to send BRP packets if the MID Extension was set to 1 as in the R-MID.
  After the responder receives a BRP-RX packet with the MID Extension set to 0, it shall respond by sending a BRP frame with feedback. This BRP frame should be sent using the best TX sector as determined in the SL8 phase, while the initiator should use a quasi-oinni pattern to receive this frame. The feedback included in this BRP frame is the number of RX AWVs to be tested in the subsequent I-BC subphase using the mem subﬁeld in the FBCK-TYPE ﬁeld. The initiator shall respond with a BRP frame with the TX-TRN-OK ﬁeld set to l as an acknowledgment. The R-BC subphase then follows.
   IfI-MID does not follow R-MID, the BC subphase follows immediately.
  Executing the BC subphase: The execution ofan I-BC subphase is used as an example. In an I-BC subphase. the initiator shall transmit wamu'TX) BRP-RX frames using the number of TX sectors speciﬁed during the BRI’ setup subphase. Each BRP-RX frame shall be appended with memu‘P‘x) TRNVR subﬁelds, and shall include the Sector 1D subﬁeld of the TX sector used. While receiving these TRNAR subﬁelds, the responder shall switch through the RX AWVs selected during the prior I- MID subphase. To conclude the I-BC subphase, the responder shall feed back to the initiator a BRI’ frame with (a) the BS-FBCK ﬁeld set to the TX sector ID ofthe BRP-RX packet received with the highest link quality, and (b) the ordered list oftransmit sectors [based on received link quality during the I-BC) using the Sector ID Order subﬁeld in the Channel Measurement Feedback element. This BRI’ frame should be sent using the best TX sector as determined in the SL5 phase, while the initiator should use a quasi-omni pattern to receive this frame. The complete procedure is illustrated in Figure 9-63, while Figure 9-64 depicts the beam combining subphase.

  In the example ofFigure 9-66, the initiator transmits an SSW-Feedback with the MID-REQ subﬁeld set to l and the BC-REQ subﬁeld set to 0 in the BRP Request field, thus requesting an MIDC with only the R-MID subphase. The responder grants the MID-REQ by setting the MID-Grant subﬁeld to l in the SSW-ACK frame. The initiator then sends a frame with the SNR Present and Sector ID Order Present subﬁelds both set to l, the Nmm. subﬁeld in the FBCK-TYPE field indicating the number of SNR measurements from the last SLS phase, and the SNR and Sector ID subfields with the SNRs measured during the SL5 phase and the list of received sectors, respectively. The L-RX subﬁeld is set according to the number of training ﬁelds the initiator needs in each packet as part of the R-MID. The responder then starts the R-MID process by transmitting BRP-RX packets.

Execution of the MID subpliase for the initiator link (i.e., I-MID) is similar, except for a change in the direction of the corresponding frames. In an R-MID subphase, the responder shall transmit one BRP-RX packet each from one of the chosen TX sectors. In each packet, it shall indicate the sector ID of the TX sector used using the Sector ID field in the BRP Request ﬁeld. Each transmitted BRP-RX packet should be appended with multiple TRN-R subﬁelds such that the initiator can train its receiver antenna during the R-MID subphase. The initiator shall train its receiver antenna by cycling through its choice of RX AWVs while receiving the TRN-R subﬁelds. The initiator shall indicate to the responder the number of TRN-R subﬁelds to be appended using the LJZX ﬁeld in the BRP request ﬁeld during the SL5 phase or the BRP setup phase. For all BRP-RX packets except the last one, the responder shall also set the MID Extension ﬁeld to 1.
 In the R-MID subphase, the initiator shall send a BRP frame with feedback. This BRP frame should be sent using the best TX sector as determined in the SL5 phase, while the responder should use a quasi-omni pattem to receive this frame. The feedback included in this BRP frame should be (a) the BS-FBCK field set to the TX sector ID ofthe BRP-RX packet received with the highest link quality, and (b) the ordered list of transmit sectors (based on received link quality during the R-MID) using the Sector ID Order subﬁeld.
      

page 338
lEEE  9.35.6341 MIDC subphase with BC subphase only  An MIDC subpliase with only the BC subphase is carried out when the MID and BC subpliases have been carried out earlier. In this case, the initiator and responder keep track oftlie TX and RX sectors, for use in the BC subphase, from earlier iterations. Since the best TX and RX sectors (in terms oflink quality) are kept track of this information can be used to deal with link blockage events. STAs can utilize only the chosen set of TX sectors in the SLS phase to reduce beamfomiing training time, andjump to the BC subphase directly without executing the MID subpliase. In this manner, fast recovery is possible when some of backup links are available after partial blockage around the STA.
  To carry out the MIDC subphase with the BC subphase only, the MID-REQ ﬁeld is set to 0 and the BC-REQ ﬁeld is set to l in SSW-Feedback or SSW-ACK or BRP frames, and the BC-Grant ﬁeld is set to l in the following SSW-ACK or BRP frame. The BC subphase can include an I-BC and/or an R-BC (9.35.631).
  9.35.6.4 BRP phase execution 9.35.6.4.1 General  Beam reﬁnement is a request/response based process. A STA requests receive beam reﬁnement training by sending a BRP frame with a nonzero value in the L-RX ﬁeld. The STA that receives a BRP frame shall respond with a BRP packet (21.10.22) including as many TRN-R ﬁelds as indicated in the value ofthe L- RX ﬁeld within the received BRP frame and with the RX-train-response ﬁeld in the DMG Beam Reﬁnement element set to 1.
  A STA requests transmit beam reﬁnement training by sending a BRP frame as follows. In the BRP Request ﬁeld, the TX-TRN-REQ ﬁeld is set to 1, and the FBCK-REQ ﬁeld is set to the desired feedback type. In the PLCP header, the Packet Type and the Training Length ﬁelds are set to indicate the number of AGC and TRN-T ﬁelds appended to the packet.
  The responding STA shall reply to the transmit beam reﬁnement training with a BRP frame containing a DMG Beam Reﬁnement element with the TX-TRN-OK ﬁeld and TX-train-response ﬁeld both set to l and the BS-FBCK ﬁeld set to indicate the TRN-T ﬁeld on which the responding STA received the best signal (the determination of best signal is implementation dependent). The FBCK—TYPE ﬁeld shall be set to according to the format of the Channel Measurement Feedback element, if one is included in the frame. If the SNR Present and Channel Measurement Present subﬁelds of this FBCK—TYPE ﬁeld are set to 0, the Channel Measurement Feedback element shall not be included. The number oftaps indicated in the FBCK- TYPE ﬁeld shall be less than or equal to the number oftaps indicated in the FBCK-REQ ﬁeld oftlie request frame.
  If a STA requests transmit beam reﬁnement training, but does not send TRN-T ﬁelds, the responding STA shall reply with a BRP frame containing a DMG Beam Reﬁnement element with the TX-TRN-OK ﬁeld set to 1. In this case (i.e., when the TX-train-response ﬁeld is equal to 0), the responding STA shall set L-RX ﬁeld to 0. The requesting STA shall then transmit a BRP packet with TRN-T ﬁelds. The responding STA shall then respond with a BRP frame with the TX-train-response ﬁeld set to 1 and the BS-FBCK and Channel Measurement Feedback element as above.
  Beam reﬁnement can start immediately following SLS (9.35.643). If the responder receives an SSW- Feedback frame from the PCP/AP in an A-BFT, the PCP/AP allocates an SP for the beam reﬁnement if required (see 9.35.5.3). A STA may transmit a BRP packet to another STA whenever the STA transmits a frame to that STA, provided that the transmitting STA knows that the recipient STA’s receive antennas are directed to it or are in a quasi-omni antenna pattern.

  A STA that has transmitted a BRP frame with the Initiator ﬁeld set to 1 and has not received a response BRPIFS after the transmission may retransmit the frame.
  A STA may request a TXSS sector list feedback by sending a BRP frame with the TXSS-FBCK-REQ ﬁeld set to l, the SNR Requested subﬁeld within the FBCK-REQ ﬁeld set to l and the remaining subﬁelds within the FBCK—REQ ﬁeld set to 0.

9.35.6.4.2 Beam refinement transaction   A beam reﬁnement transaction is a set of BRP frames composed of request and responses.
  A beam reﬁnement transaction starts with the beamfonning initiator STA sending a BRP frame with the Initiator ﬁeld set to l.
  A beam reﬁnement responder is a STA that receives a BRP frame (which is directed to it) with the Initiator ﬁeld set to 1.
   A beam reﬁnement transaction participant shall respond to a BRP frame with a BRP frame.
  If the beam reﬁnement transaction initiator received a BRP frame from the responder with no training requests, the initiator may temiinate the transaction by not transmitting any further BRP packets.
   Figure 9-67, Figure 9-68, and Figure 9-69 show examples of beam reﬁnement transactions.
9.35.6.4.3 Beam refinement transaction after SLS  If either L-RX or TX-TRN-REQ is nonzero within the BRP Request ﬁeld in the SSW-ACK frame of the most recent SLS phase execution, no MID or BC was granted during the BRP setup subphase, and no beam reﬁnement transaction has been done since the most recent SLS phase execution, then the initiator shall initiate the beam reﬁnement transaction with the responder by sending a BRP frame to the responder. Ifthe value ofthe L-RX ﬁeld is greater than 0 in the SSW-ACK frame, the ﬁrst BRP frame the initiator transmits to the responder is a BRP-RX frame. Ifthe value ofthe L-RX ﬁeld is 0 and the value ofthe TX-TRN-REQ ﬁeld is l, the ﬁrst BRP frame the initiator transmits to the responder shall have either the TX-TRN-OK ﬁeld set to l or the L-RX ﬁeld greater than 0.

If the STA has not received a BRP frame since the last SLS and the SL5 did not include an RXSS, the STA should set its antennas to a quasi-omni antenna pattern.
  In a BRP-RX packet, all TRN-R ﬁelds shall be transmitted using the same TX AWV conﬁguration as the preamble and data ﬁelds of the packet, except if both the transmitting and receiving STAs support the OtheriAID subﬁeld as indicated through the Supports OtheriAID ﬁeld set to 1 within the STA’s DMG Capabilities element and the value oftlie OtheriAID subﬁeld within the BRP Request ﬁeld is different from 0, in which case the TRN-R ﬁelds shall be transmitted using the best known TX AWV conﬁguration for transmitting to the STA with AID equal to the value of the OtheriAID subﬁeld within the BRP Request ﬁeld.

A DMG BlockAck with ﬂow control can be established only when both originator and recipient support this capability.
  9.36.2 DMG Black Ack architecture with ﬂow control  The DMG Block Ack niles are explained in terms ofthe architecture shown in Figure 9-74 and explained in this subclause.
  The originator contains a Transmit Butfer Control that uses WinStartO, BufSizeO, and WinLimitO to submit MPDUs for transmission, and releases transmit buffers upon receiving BlockAck frames from the recipient or when it advances the transmit control butter window.
  WinSlartO is the starting sequence number of the transmit range, WinLimitO is the last sequence number expected to exhaust the receiver butter capacity, and [in/Shea is the number of buffers negotiated in the   Block Ack agreement.
  Figure 9-75 shows the DMG Block Ack with ﬂow control and its associated parameters from the Originator perspective.

It can adjust the Ack Policy ﬁeld of transmitted data ﬁames according to the rules deﬁned in 9.21.7.7 in order to solicit Block Ack responses.
  The recipient contains a Receive Reorder-ing Buffer Control per TA/TID, which contains related control state.
  The receive reordering buffer is responsible for reordering MSDUs or A-MSDUs so that MSDUs or A- MSDUs are eventually passed up to the next MAC process in order of received sequence number (SN). It maintains its own state independent of the Scoreboard Context Control to perform this reordering as speciﬁed in 9.21.7.6. The delivery of in order MSDUs or A-MSDUs to the next MAC process is implementation dependent. In some cases, the receiver reordering buffer might be forced to hold on to MSDUs ready for in order delivery due to deferred reception at the next MAC process. This behavior can impose additional buffering requirements on the receiver, causing the actual available buffer capacity to vary dynamically. The reordering buffer is required to manage its lowest and highest (in order) SN, which are marked as WinTuiIB and WinHem/B, respectively.
  The scoreboard context control provides the WinCapacityE, actually controlled by the Reordering buffer in  addition to the bitmap ﬁeld and the Starting Sequence Number [SSN) ﬁeld to be sent in Block/\ck responses to the originator.

  Ifthe Dialog Token ﬁeld in the Link Measurement Request frame is equal to 0, the responding STA may set the MCS ﬁeld in the Link Measurement Report frame to the MCS value computed based on any of the received frames from the requesting STA.
  The SNR ﬁeld and Link Margin ﬁeld in the Link Measurement Report frame shall indicate the corresponding measurements based on the reception of the PPDU that was used to generate the MCS feedback contained in the same Link Measurement Report frame.
  The Link Measurement Request and Report frames can be used to obtain Link Margin infonnation, which can be used to detennine appropriate action by the requesting STA (e.g., change MCS or control transmit power or initiate FST).
   A STA may send an unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame with the Dialog Token ﬁeld set to 0.

Otherwise, the STA does not support fast link adaptation. A STA that supports fast link adaptation shall not use fast link adaptation with a peer STA that does not support fast link adaptation.
  A STA that supports fast link adaptation shall support the reverse direction protocol (sec 9.25). The STA that transmits a Link Measurement Request frame as part offast link adaptation shall be the RD initiator and the STA that responds with a Link Measurement Report frame shall be the RD responder. Transmission of Link Measurement Request, Link Measurement Report and the frames deﬁned below shall follow the rules of the reverse direction protocol.
  A STA initiates fast link adaptation by transmitting a Link Measurement Request frame of subtype Action No Ack and that has the Dialog Token ﬁeld set to 0.

  NOTEiThe PI’DUS have the AGGREGATION parameter in the TXVECTOR set to AGGREGATED to allow padding ofthe PSI.)le with MPDU delimiters of size 0, therefore meeting the transmission duration requirement.
  A STA supporting fast link adaptation and that receives a Link Measurement Request frame of subtype Action No Ack, with the Dialog Token ﬁeld equal to 0 and contained in a PPDU with the AGGREGATION parameter in the RXVECTOR equal to AGGREGATED shall respond with a Link Measurement Report frame in no longer than BRPIFS from the reception of the Link Measurement Request frame. The TPC Report element, DMG Link Margin element and other ﬁelds transmitted in the Link Measurement Report frame shall reﬂect measurements on the PPDU that contained the last received Link Measurement Request frame from the initiating STA.
  The STA responding with the Link Measurement Report frame shall keep the IFS not longer than SIFS by transmitting PPDUs that do not contain frames requiring immediate response and that have a duration that is greater than 5.27 ps. All transmitted PPDUs should use the same MCS and the same transmit power.
  The transmitted Link Measurement Report frame shall be of subtype Action No Ack, shall be sent using MCS l, and shall be sent within a PPDU with the AGGREGATION parameter in the TXVECTOR set to AGGREGATED. In addition, the PPDU shall not contain any frame that requires immediate response and shall have a duration that is greater than 5.27 us.
  If at least one ofthe conditions above for the transmission ofthe Link Measurement Report frame is not met, the STA may follow the rules in 9.37.1 to respond to the received Link Measurement Request frame.
  A STA that supports fast link adaptation and that receives a Link Measurement Report frame should respond with an unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame in no longer than BRPIFS from the reception of the Link Measurement Report frame. The TPC Report element, DMG Link Margin element and other ﬁelds transmitted in the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame shall reﬂect measurements taken on one or more of the PPDUs received by the STA transmitting the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame, starting with the received Link Measurement Report frame itself. If the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame is transmitted longer than SIFS from the reception of the Link Measurement Report frame, the STA transmitting the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame shall keep the IFS not longer than SIFS by transmitting one or more PPDUs before issuing the unsolicited Link Measurement Report frame.

  9.39 DMG relay operation 9.39.1 General  The DMG relay procedures are specified in 10.35. This subclause speciﬁes the supported types of DMG relay.
   A source REDS, a destination REDS and an RDS can establish two types ofrelay operation:
  7 Link switching (9.39.2): If the direct link between the source REDS and destination REDS is disrupted, the source REDS redirects the transmission of frames addressed to the destination REDS via the RDS. The RDS forwards frames received from the source REDS to the destination REDS and from the destination REDS to the source REDS. Direct communication between the source REDS and destination REDS can resume after the direct link between them is recovered.
  7 Link cooperating (9.39.3): In this case, the RDS is actively involved in the direct communication between the source REDS and the destination REDS. A frame transi on from the source REDS to the destination REDS is simultaneously repeated by the RDS, which can possibly increase the signal quality received at the destination REDS.
     9.39.2 Link switching type 9.39.2.1 General  A source REDS that has successfully completed an RLS procedure with a destination REDS for which the value of the Cooperation-Mode subfield within the negotiated Relay Transfer Parameter Set element is 0 may use the selected RDS between the source REDS and destination REDS for the purpose of link switching. This is described in this subclause.
  9.39.2.2 SP request and allocation  The source REDS uses the procedures described in 10.4 to request an SP allocation between itself and the destination REDS.
  Upon receiving an ADDTS Request frame for which the source AID and the destination AID fields within the DMG TSPEC element are equal to a pair ofa source REDS and a destination REDS, respectively, that have successfully completed the RLS procedure defined in 10.35.24, the PCP/AP schedules an SP with the source DMG STA as the source REDS and the destination DMG STA as the destination REDS.
  An RDS shall check the value ofthe source AID and the destination AID fields of each SP allocation within an Extended Schedule element it receives in a DMG Beacon or Announce frame from the PCP/AP. Ifthe value ofthe source AID and the destination AID fields ofan SP allocation correspond to a source REDS and a destination REDS, respectively, that have successfully completed the RLS setup procedure (1035.2), the RDS shall operate as an RDS during that SP allocation.
  9.39.2.3 Usage of RDS  In link switching type, an RDS operates either in FD-AF mode or in IID-DF mode. An RDS capable of FD- AF relaying shall be in one oftwo frame transmission modes:
      

page 353
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.113d-2012  7 Normal mode: A pair of source REDS and destination REDS exchange frames via either the direct link or the relay link until this link is determined to become unavailable due to, for example, blockage or channel degradation.
  7 Alternation mode: A source REDS and a destination REDS exchange frames via two separate links, where the use of each link alternates at each Link Change Interval. The Link Change Interval specifies the time instants at which a source REDS is allowed to change the link used for a frame transmission to the destination REDS as speciﬁed in 8.4.2.151.
   An RDS that supports only IID-DF shall operate in the Normal mode.
  The frame transmission mode is indicated in the Relay Transfer Parameter Set element exchanged by the source REDS, destination REDS, and RDS during the RLS procedure. A source REDS or destination REDS may change the transmission mode used in a relay link following a successful exchange of RLS Request and RLS Response frames as described in 10.35.14.
  An RDS shall start to operate as RDS at the start of an SP for which the value of the source AID and destination AID fields for that SP are equal to the source REDS and destination REDS, respectively, for which the RDS has successfully completed the RLS procedure. The RDS can detemiine the SPs for which it operates as an RDS upon the reception of an Extended Schedule element.
  9.39.2.4 Relay frame exchange rules 9.39.2.4.1 General  Following the completion of the RLS procedure and SP allocation, each of the source REDS, destination REDS, and RDS have a direct link with one another.
  The values of Link Change Interval and Data Sensing Time are indicated within the Relay Transfer Parameter Set transmitted by the source REDS to the destination REDS during the RLS procedure. Either the Link Change Interval period or the First Period begins at the start ofan SP between the source REDS and the destination REDS, and any transmission by the source REDS, destination REDS, and RDS within a Link Change Interval period shall use the same link that is used at the start ofthe Link Change Interval period. A new Link Change Interval period starts immediately after another Link Change Interval period, but shall not exceed the end ofthe SP.
  In the nomial mode, a source REDS shall use the direct link to initiate frame transmission to the destination REDS at the start ofthe ﬁrst SP allocated between the source REDS and destination REDS for a particular TID. At the start of the following SP allocations for that same TID, the source REDS uses the last link in which a frame transmission to the destination REDS via this link was successful. In the alternation mode, the source DMG STA shall altemate the frame transmission to the destination REDS between direct frame transmission to the destination REDS and frame transmission through the RDS. The source REDS shall alternate the link used for a frame transmission at the start of each Link Change Interval.
  If a source REDS transmits a frame to the destination REDS via the direct link but does not receive an expected ACK frame or BA frame from the destination REDS during a Link Change Interval period, the source REDS should change the link used for frame transm on at the start of the following Link Change Interval period and use the RDS to forward frames to the destination REDS.
     If a source REDS transmits a frame to the destination REDS via the RDS but does not receive an expected ACK frame or BA frame from the RDS during a Link Change Interval period or a First Period, the source REDS should change the link used for frame transmission at the start ofthe following Link Change Interval period or the following First Period and transmit frames directly to the destination REDS.

If the Alternation mode is used, the source REDS altenlates the link used for frame transmission at the start ofeach Link Change Interval period, and the value of Data Sensing Time is ignored.
  In the Nonnal nlode, if the destination REDS does not receive a valid frame from the source REDS within Data Sensing Time after the start ofa Link Change Interval, the destination REDS shall immediately change the link to attempt to receive frames from the source REDS through the RDS.

Note that tllis is the only situation when Data Sensing Time is used in the Altemation mode.
       9.39.143 Additional frame exchange rules for HD-DF RDS  When the RDS is operating as a IID-DF RDS and the RDS is used ill tlle frame exchange between the source REDS and tlle destination REDS, the frame exchange is perfomled ill two periods, which are repeated for as long as tlle RDS is used. In the First Period, the source REDS sllall transmit a frame to the RDS and then the RDS responds after SIFS if needed. In the Second Period, the RDS shall forward the frame received from the source REDS to tlle destination REDS, and then the destination REDS responds after SIFS ifneeded.
 The duration oftlle First Period and the Second Period are specified in tlle last Relay Transfer Parameter Set elenlent transmitted fronl the source REDS.
  The First Period and Second Period are valid only when the source REDS and destination REDS exchange  frames via the RDS. The Link Change Interval is valid only when the source REDS and destination REDS exchange frames via the direct link. The First Period begins at the end of the Link Cllange Interval when a  324 Copyrlght © 2012 IEEE. All nghts reserved,

  The source REDS may transmit a Relay ACK Request frame to the RDS to determine whether all frames forwarded through the RDS were successfully received by the destination REDS. Upon reception ofa Relay ACK Request frame, the RDS shall respond with a Relay ACK Response frame and set the BlockAck Bitmap field to indicate which frames have been successfully received by the destination REDS.
  If the source REDS decides to change to the relay link at the start of the following Link Change Interval period, the source REDS shall stan its frame transmission at the start ofthe following Link Change Interval period. Ifthe current link is the direct link and the destination REDS does not receive a valid frame from the source REDS within Data Sensing Time after the stan ofeach Link Change Interval, the destination REDS shall change the link and consider the First Period to begin at the start ofthe Link Change Interval.
  Ifa link change to the direct link occurs, the source REDS shall start to transmit a frame using the direct link at the end ofthe Second Period when the Link Change Interval begins. The destination REDS shall switch to the direct link at each First Period and listen to the medium toward the source REDS. If the destination REDS receives a valid frame from the source REDS, the destination REDS shall remain on the direct link and consider the Link Change Interval to begin at the start of the First Period. Otherwise, the destination REDS shall change the link at the start of the next Second Period and attempt to receive frames from the source REDS through the RDS. If the active link is the relay link and the More Data ﬁeld in the last frame received from the RDS is equal to 0, then the destination REDS shall not switch to the direct link even if it does not receive any frame during the Second Period.
  The source REDS that intends to use the Block Ack mechanism through the RDS shall perform the Block Ack setup procedure with the RDS using the same TID as it is used for the direct communication between the source REDS and the destination REDS. Similarly, the RDS shall perform the Block Ack setup procedure with the destination REDS before transmitting data using the Block Ack mechanism. Upon reception of an ADDBA Request frame from the source REDS, the RDS shall send an ADDBA Request frame to the destination REDS with the same content for all corresponding ﬁelds as the ADDBA Request frame received from the source REDS, except for Buffer Size field, which contains the buffer size of the RDS. Following the reception of the ADDBA Response frame from the destination REDS, the RDS shall send an ADDBA Response frame to the source REDS. The ADDBA Response frame shall have the same content for all corresponding fields as the ADDBA Response frame received from the destination REDS, except for the Buffer Size field, which shall be set to the minimum between the buffer size ofthe RDS and the destination REDS.

iEEE  9.39.2.4.4 Operation of FD-AF RDS  In an SP allocated for relay operation, a FD-AF RDS operates in an amplify-and-forward manner. This means that for each frame detected at the RF in the receive state within an SP in which it operates as a FD- AF RDS, the RDS ampliﬁes the received signal and simultaneously retransmits it via the RF in transmit state.
  At the start of the SP where it operates as a FD-AF RDS, the RDS shall initiate an RF antenna module in the receive state directed toward the source REDS and another RF antenna module in transmit state directed toward the destination REDS.
  For each frame received at the RDS during the SP, the RDS shall follow the same rules for frame exchange sequences as described in Annex G and 9.33. Thi 'ncludes switching the state of each RF available to the RDS from receive to transmit, and vice-versa, depending upon the frame type and its ACK policy.
     9.39.2.5 Link monitoring  After a link change, the source REDS might periodically monitor the quality ofthe previous link. To do that, the source REDS can use the link change mechanism described in 9.39.2.4. lfthe previous link is the relay link, the source REDS can acquire the channel status by using relay link measurement mechanism as described in 9.39.4. lfthe previous link is the direct link, the source REDS can acquire the channel status via the link adaptation mechanism deﬁned in 9.37. lfthe channel quality of the previous link is better than the one on the current link, which is an implementation-dependent decision, the source REDS may switch to the previous link.
  9.39.3 Link cooperating type  9.39.3.1 TPA procedure  A source REDS, a destination REDS, and an RDS use the common relay setup procedure deﬁned in 10.352 to set up a link cooperating relay. In addition, to establish a link cooperating relay, the source REDS,  destination REDS, and RDS shall perform the TPA procedure described in this subclause and shown in Figure 9-79.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  The TPA procedure is triggered by the destination REDS following the common relay setup procedure with the source REDS and RDS. First, the destination REDS uses the procedures described in 10.4 to request the allocation of an SP to perform TPA, wherein the source of the SP is the destination REDS and the destination ofthe SP is the source REDS. Ifthe value ofa source AID and the destination AID ﬁelds of an SP allocation correspond to a destination REDS and a source REDS, respectively, that have successfully completed the RLS setup procedure, the DMG STA that performs as an RDS in that SP allocation shall operate during the allocation as a non-RDS-capable DMG STA.
  Within the allocated SP, the destination REDS sends a TPA Request frame to the RDS and sets the Timing Offset ﬁeld to zero [see Figure 9-79). SBIFS interval following the end of the first TPA Request frame transmission, the destination REDS shall send the second TPA Request frame to the source REDS and set the Timing Offset ﬁeld to zero. aDtime interval (10.38) following the reception of the ﬁrst TPA Request frame, the RDS shall transmit a TPA Response frame back to the destination REDS. Upon receiving the TPA Response frame from the RDS, the destination REDS sliall estimate the TPA value of the RDS and the time deviation (i.e., ZXdTDR) between the expected Dtime and the actual arrival time ofthe TPA Response frame. aDtime interval following the reception of the second TPA Request frame, the source REDS shall transmit a TPA Response frame back to the destination REDS. The destination REDS shall repeat the same procedure upon reception ofthe TPA Response frame received from the source REDS.
  SBIFS interval following the end ofthe transmission ofthe TPA Response frame to the destination REDS, the source REDS shall send a TPA Request frame to the RDS and set the Timing Offset ﬁeld to zero. aDtime interval following the reception of the TPA Request frame, the RDS shall transmit a TPA Response frame back to the source REDS. Upon reception ofthe TPA Response frame from the RDS, the source REDS shall estimate the TPA value of the RDS and the time deviation (i.e., 2><dTSR) between aDtime and the actual arrival time of the TPA Response frame.
  At aRelayTPATime [10.38) from the end of the last TPA Request frame transmitted by the destination REDS to the source REDS, the destination REDS shall send a TPA Request frame to the RDS and set the Timing Offset ﬁeld to dTDS—dTDR. Upon reception ofthe TPA Request frame, the RDS shall transmit a TPA Response frame to the destination REDS at aDtime+dTDR+[dTDrdTDR) from the end of the TPA Request frame. Upon reception of the TPA Response frame, the destination REDS shall estimate the time deviation (i.e., ZXdTDRHdTDrdTDR» between aDtime and the actual arrival time ofthe TPA Response frame. Iftlie destination REDS determines that the estimated deviation is equal to ZXdTDRHdTDS—dTDR), then the destination REDS considers that the TPA procedure was successful. As the last step ofthe TPA procedure, the destination REDS shall send a TPA Report frame to the source REDS that includes the infomiation regardless of whether the last TPA procedure succeeded.
  If it is not successful, the TPA procedure is repeated until it is successful or upon the decision of the destination REDS to stop perfomiing the TPA procedure. The TPA procedure can include the estimation of the sampling frequency-offset (SFO), in order for the source REDS and RDS to adjust their SFOs.
  9.39.3.2 Frame exchange operation  9.39.3.2.1 General  A source REDS that has successfully completed an RLS procedure with a destination REDS for which the value ofthe Cooperation-Mode subﬁeld within the negotiated Relay Transfer Parameter Set element is equal to l and has successfully completed the TPA procedure shall use the selected RDS between the source REDS and destination REDS for the purpose oflink cooperation. This is described in this subclause.
  9.39.3.2.2 Cooperative transmission SP request and allocation  If the source REDS receives a TPA Report frame that indicates the successful completion of the TPA procedure with the RDS and the destination REDS, the source REDS uses the procedure in 10.4 to request

lEEE  an SP allocation with the destination REDS. The source REDS can use the SP allocation for communication with the destination REDS with the assistance ofthe RDS.
  9.39.3.2.3 Data transmission rules As shown in the example of Figure 9-80, in the allocated SP the first time interval (T1) and the second time  interval [T2) for a cooperative data frame transfer are determined by the packet transmission time at each transmission from the source REDS to the destination REDS within the SP.

At the start of each time T1, the source REDS transmits a frame with its transmit antenna patteni directed towards the RDS and with the TA and the RA ﬁelds in the MAC header set to the MAC address ofthe source REDS and destination REDS, respectively. After l’time+dTSR from the start of T2, the source REDS retransmits the same frame sent to the RDS during the previous time T1 but now with its transmit antenna pattern directed towards the destination REDS. Similarly, after Ptime+[dTD57dTDR) from the start of T2, the RDS retransmits the same frame it received from the source REDS during the previous time T1. So that the destination REDS can take advantage of the improved received signal level from both of these transmissions, the destination REDS should set its receive antenna pattem during T2 such that it simultaneously covers the links towards both the source REDS and the RDS.
   The Ack policy used during an SP where link cooperation is in use is the same as defined in Clause 9.
9.39.4 Relay link adaptation  When a relay link is used for communication between a source REDS and a destination REDS, the link qualities ofthe S-R link, the R-D link, and the S-D link might be required.
  The source REDS, destination REDS, and RDS use the procedure described in 9.37 to request and repon the link quality among themselves with the following exception. In the Link Measurement Report frame the RDS transmits to the source REDS, the RDS shall include two Link Margin elements in this order:
   7 The first Link Margin element shall report the link quality between the source REDS and the RDS.
  7 The second Link Margin element shall report the link quality between the RDS and the destination REDS.
  Upon reception ofa Link Measurement Report frame, the source REDS can take several actions including changing the MCS it uses for frame transmission to the RDS and destination REDS.

  In an infrastructure BSS or in a PBSS, the AP in the infrastnrcture BSS or the PCP in the PBSS shall be the timing master for the TSF. A STA that is the AP or the PCP shall initialize its TSF timer independently of any simultaneously started APs or PCPs respectively, in an effort to minimize the synchronization of the TSF timers of multiple APs or PCPs. In a non-DMG BSS Tthe AP shall periodically transmit special frames called Beacon fr'amex, In a DMG BSS the PCP/AP shall neriodically transmit snecial frames called DMG Beacon and Announce frame: which provide a similar function to the Beacon frame in a non-DMG BSS.
 Beacon DMG Beacon and Announce frames thaecontain the value of'itsthe PCP’s or AP’s TSF timer to synchronize the TSF timers of other STAs in a BSS. A receiving STA shall accept the timing information in Beacon DMG Beacon and Announce frames sent from the AP and PCP servicing its BSS. Ifa STA’s TSF timer is different from the timestamp in the received Beacon DMG Beacon or Announce frame, the receiving STA shall set its local TSF timer to the received timestamp value.
              In a non-DMG BSS Beacon frames shall be generated for transmission by the AP once every dotl lBeaconPeriod TUs. In a DMG infrastructure BSS zero or more DMG Beacon frames shall be generated for transmission b the AP every dotl lBeaconPeriod TUS (see 10.13.23). The AP shall transmit at least one DMG Beacon frame throu h each sector available to the AP within a time interval that is not lon er than dotl lBeaconPeriod >< dotl lMaxLostBeacons TUs. The TXSS Snan ﬁeld in the DMG Beacon shall be set to a value that is less than or equal to the dotl lMaxLostBeacons attribute.

10.1.3.2a Beacon generation in a DMG infrastructure BSS and in a PBSS  10.1.3.2a.1 General  A DMG STA acting as a PCP/AP follows the DMG channel access procedures (see 9.33) and the rules described in this subclause to transmit DMG Beacon frames.
  Each DMG Beacon frame transmitted by a PCP and by a DMG AP shall have the Discovery Mode ﬁeld within the DMG Beacon set to 0.
  The Duration field ofeach transmitted DMG Beacon frame shall be set to the time remaining until the end of the current BTI.
  A PCP and a DMG AP establish a series of Target Beacon Transmission Times (TBTTs) spaced dotl lBeaconPeriod TUs apart. The period between two TBTTs is referred to as the beacon interval. The beacon interval length shall be no more than aMaxBlDuration. Time value zero ofthe TSF is defined to be a TBTT with a DMG Beacon frame transmitted at the beginning ofthe beacon interval.
  The length of the beacon interval is included in the DMG Beacon, Announce, and Probe Response frames, and the DMG STAs shall adopt that beacon interval when joining the BSS.
  A PCP and a DMG AP that move the TBTT (10.302) or change the beacon interval duration (10.303) shall reestablish the TBTT by resetting the TSF to zero at the time the BSS parameter change takes effect in the BSS.
  At each BTI, a PCP and a DMG AP schedule DMG Beacon frames for transmission according to the procedure specified in 9.35.4. Subject to this constraint, the PCP/AP may delay the DMG Beacon transmission if the medium is determined by the CCA mechanism to be busy. When delaying a DMG Beacon transmission, the PCP/AP shall check that the ET], A-BFT, and ATI do not overlap in time with pseudo-static SPs for which the PCP/AP is not the source DMG STA and, if PCP/AP clustering is in use, that the DMG Beacon transmission follows the additional rules described in 9.34.
      

page 361
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.113d-2012  A PCP/AP may transmit DMG Beacon frames through different antenna configurations during the BTI, but shall not transmit more than one DMG Beacon frame through the same antenna conﬁguration during the BTI ofany beacon interval. For any beacon interval that does not include a DMG Beacon transmission in the BTI, the AP shall begin the beacon interval with an ATL and the PCP begins the beacon interval with an ATI (10.2.5.3).
  When the DMG Beacon transmission is perfonned as multiple directional transmissions, a PCP/AP should change the sequence of directions through which a DMG Beacon is transmitted after it has transmitted a DMG Beacon frame through each direction in the current sequence ofdirections. When the ECPAC Policy Enforced ﬁeld is equal to l in the DMG Beacon frame most recently transmitted by a PCP/AP, then  7 When the PCP/AP transmits a DMG Beacon frame as multiple directional transmissions, the PCP/ AP shall change the sequence of directions through which a DMG Beacon frame is transmitted after it has transmitted a DMG Beacon frame through each direction in the current sequence ofdirections.
  7 When the PCP/AP transmits a DMG Beacon frame as a single transmission, the PCP/AP shall randomly delay the transmission of the DMG Beacon frame by up to min(4XTXTlME[DMG Beacon), 1024Xdotl lMinBlllDuration) us after the TBTT.
  This is done to randomize and potentially minimize interference to/from the DMG Beacon. One such example is indicated in Figure lO-la. If the sequence of directions is changed, the sequence of directions shall be pseudorandomly chosen from a sequence of directions covering the full set ofdirections available to a PCP/AP.

iEEE  10.1.3.2b DMG Beacon generation before network initialization  A DMG STA can transmit DMG Beacon frames before network initialization to discover and perform beamfomiing during the A-BFT with another DMG STA so that the following frame exchanges between these DMG STAs do not have to be done as a sector sweep (see 10.1.4.3.3).
  A DMG STA that transmits DMG Beacon frames before network initialization shall set the Discovery Mode ﬁeld in each transmitted DMG Beacon frame to 1 to indicates that the network initialization procedure deﬁned in 10.1.4.4 has not been performed. In addition, the STA shall set the Next A-BFT ﬁeld to 0.
  Before network initialization, the spacing between TBTTs can change, and the time to the next TBTT is contained in each DMG Beacon transmitted at the last BTI. At each TBTT, the DMG STA should generate a random value for the Beacon Interval ﬁeld within the DMG Beacon frame from a unifomi distribution between [10 TUs, 200 TUs), i.e., 10 TUs inclusive through 200 TUs exclusive. All DMG Beacon frame transmissions within the same BTI shall have the same value for the Beacon Interval ﬁeld.
  The TSF shall be set to 0 at the ﬁrst TBTT for which the Discovery Mode ﬁeld within the DMG Beacon frame is equal to 1. After that, the TSF shall be set to 0 at the TBTT of the beacon interval in which the DMG STA changes the value ofthe Beacon Interval ﬁeld.
  The DMG STA shall transmit the ﬁrst DMG Beacon frame ofthe next BTI at the time indicated by the start ofthe transmission of the ﬁrst DMG Beacon frame within the last BTI and the value of the Beacon Interval ﬁeld contained in the DMG Beacon frame transmitted within the last BTI, unless the medium is determined by the CCA mechanism to be busy in which case the DMG STA may delay the transmission of the ﬁrst DMG Beacon transmission.
  A DMG STA that transmits a DMG Beacon frame with the Discovery Mode ﬁeld equal to 1 may indicate the STA(s) that is allowed to respond in the A-BFT following the BTI where the DMG Beacon frame is transmitted. To do that, in the DMG Beacon the DMG STA shall set the CC Present ﬁeld to 1 and shall set the A-BFT Responder Address subﬁeld to an individual address or to a group address of a group that includes the STA(s) that is allowed to respond in the A-BFT.
  A DMG STA that is transmitting DMG Beacon frames with the Discovery Mode ﬁeld equal to 1 should conﬁgure its receive antenna to a quasi-omni antenna pattern and stay in receiving state during portions of the DTI deﬁned by the DMG Beacon transmissions. This enables the DMG STA to receive frames transmitted by any DMG STA that is covered by this antenna pattern.
  A DMG STA that is transmitting DMG Beacon frames with the Discovery Mode ﬁeld equal to 1 should cease transmitting these beacons when it has received a DMG Beacon frame from another STA, or when it has received acknowledgment ofa transmitted Probe Response frame. Ifa BSS is not initialized as a result of the channel scanning, the DMG STA can resume transmitting DMG Beacon frames with the Discovery Mode ﬁeld equal to 1.
  The procedure of TBTT change described in the preceding paragraph is applicable for DMG Beacon generation before network initialization, whereas the procedures deﬁned in 10.302 and 10.30.} are used to   change the DMG BSS parameters aﬁer the infrastructure BSS and PBSS are initialized.
  The DMG STA shall set the Duration ﬁeld of each transmitted DMG Beacon frame to the time remaining until the end ofthe current BTI.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  10.1.3.3 Beacon generation in an IBSS Change theﬂrxt paragraph in 10.1.3.3 asﬁulms:
  Beacon generation in an IBSS is distributed. The beacon period is included in Beacon Announce and Probe Response frames, and STAs shall adopt that beacon period when joining the IBSS. All members ofthe IBSS participate in beacon geueratiou. Each STA shall maintain its own TSF timer that is used for dotllBeaconPeriod timing. The beacon interval within an IBSS is established by the STA at which the MLME-START.request primitive is performed to create the IBSS. This deﬁnes a series of TBTTs exactly dotl lBeaconPeriod TUs apart. Time zero is deﬁned to be a TBTT. At each TBTT the STA shall  a) Suspend the decrementing of the backoff timer for any pending transmission that is not a non- Beacon or DMG Beacon frametra-nsm-ission,     b) Calculate a random delay unifonnly distributed in the range between zero and twice aCWminX aSlotTime when the STA is a non-DMG STA and between zero and the result of two multiplied b aCWminDMGIBSS multiplied by the duration oftlre STA’s following BTI when the STA is a DMG m.
  c) Wait for the period of the random delay, decrementing the random delay timer using the same algorithm as for backoff,  d) Cancel the remaining random delay and the pending Beacon frame transmission or BTI DMG only , ifa Beacon frame arrives from the IBSS of which the STA is a member before the random delay timer has expired,  e) Send a Beacon frame in a non-DMG BSS or DMG Beacou frame(s) in a DMG BSS if the random delay has expired and no Beacon frame in a non-DMG BSS or no DMG Beacon frame in a DMG BSS has arrived from the IBSS of which the STA is a member during the delay period,  f) If the ATIM Wiudow in use within the IBSS is greater than 0, then  1) Resume decrementing the backoff timer for any pending transmission allowed inside the ATIM window and           2) At the time of the ATIM Window duration, resume the backoff for any pending frames intended for transmission outside the ATIM Wiudow,  g) If the ATIM Window in use within the IBSS is 0, then resume decrementing the backofftimer for any pending transmissions.
  10.1.3.5 Beacon reception Change the seam/1 and thinlpurugruphx 0f10. 1.3.5 asﬁulmx:
  STAs in an infrastructure network or PBSS shall use iufonnation that is not in the CF Parameter Set element in received Beacon frames or DMG Beacon frames or Announce frames only if the BSSID field is equal to the MAC address currently in use by the STA contained in the AP of the BSS or to the MAC address currently in use by the PCP of the PBSS. Non-AP or non-PCP STAs in an infrastructure or PBSS network, respectively that support the Multiple BSSID capability shall use other information in received Beacou g DMG Beacou frames only if the BSSID field ofa non-AP or non-PCP STA is equal to the MAC address currently in use by the STA contained in the AP or PCP respectively of the BSS corresponding to the transmitted BSSID or if the BSSID field ofa non-AP or non-PCP STA is equal to one oftlre uontrausmitted BSSIDs.
     STAs in an non-DMG IBSS shall use infomration that is not in the CF Parameter Set element in any received Beacou frame for which the IBSS subfreld of the Capability field is 1, the content of the SSID element is equal to the SSID ofthe IBSS, and the TSF value is later than the receiving STA’s TSF timer.

Use ofthis information is speciﬁed in 10.1.5.
  A STA shall ignore the BSS Type ﬁeld contained in a received DMG Beacon frame ifthe Discovery Mode ﬁeld within the DMG Beacon is 1.
  An active STA operating in a BSS shall be ready to receive a DMG Beacon or a frame from the PCP/AP for a period of time of at least dotllMinBlIlDuration following the TBTT or expected ATl start time as speciﬁed in the last Next DMG ATl element (8.4.2.137) transmitted by the PCP/AP.
  An active DMG STA that is receive beamfonning trained with the PCP/AP shall direct its receive antenna pattern toward the PCP/AP or use a quasi-omni antenna pattern during this time.
  A non-PCP STA that receives a DMG Beacon frame from a PCP in which the PCP Association Ready ﬁeld is 0 shall not transmit an Association Request frame addressed to the PCP that transmitted the received DMG Beacon. A non-PCP STA that receives a DMG Beacon frame from a PCP with the PCP Association Ready ﬁeld set to 1 may transmit an Association Request frame addressed to the PCP that transmitted the received DMG Beacon.
  10.1.3.6 Multiple BSSID procedure Change 10.1.3.6 usfallnws:
  Implementation ofthe Multiple BSSID capability is optional for a WNM STA and for a DMG STA. A STA that implements the Multiple BSSID capability has dot1lMgmtOptionMultiBSSIDlmplemented set to true.
 When dot1lMgmtOptionMultiBSSIDImplemented is true, dotl lWirelessManagementlmplemented shall be set true except for a DMG STA in which case it ma be set to false. A STA that has a value of true for dotl1MgmtOptionMultiBSSIDActivated is deﬁned as a STA that supports the Multiple BSSID capability.
 A STA for which dotl1MgmtOptionMultiBSSlDActivated is true shall set the Multiple BSSID ﬁeld of the Extended Capabilities element to 1.
     The nontransmitted BSSID proﬁle shall include the SSID element (see 8.4.2.2) and Multiple BSSID-Index element (see 8.4.2.76) for each of the supported BSSle. The HAP may optionally include all other elements in the nontransmitted BSSID proﬁle. The PCP/AP may include two or more Multiple BSSID elements containing elements for a given BSSID index in one Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame. lftwo or more are given, the proﬁle is considered to be the complete set ofall elements given in all such Multiple BSSID elements sharing the same BSSID index. Since the Multiple BSSID element is also present in Probe Response frames, an HAP may choose to advertise the complete or a partial proﬁle of a BSS corresponding to a nontransmitted BSSID only in the Probe Response frames. In addition, the ﬂAP may choose to include only a partial list of nontransmitted BSSID profiles in the Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame or to include different sets of nontransmitted BSSID proﬁles in different Beacon frames or DMG Beacon frames.
     When a station receives a Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame with a Multiple BSSID element that consists ofa nontransmitted BSSID proﬁle with only the mandatory elements, it may inherit the complete proﬁle from a previously received Beacon frame DMG Beacon frame or Probe Response frame, or it may send a Probe Request frame to obtain the complete BSSID proﬁles. Each Beacon element not transmitted in a nontransmitted BSSID subelement is inherited from a previous Beacon DMG Beacon or Probe Response frame in which the element is present, except for the Quiet element, which shall take effect only in the Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame that contains it and not carry forward as a part of the inheritance. An HAP is not required to include all supported nontransmitted BSSID proﬁles in a Probe Response frame

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  and may choose to include only a subset based on any criteria. When a nontransmitted BSSID proﬁle is present in the Multiple BSSID element ofthe Probe Response frame, the ﬂAP shall include all elements that are speciﬁc to this BSS. Ifany ofthe optional elements is not present in a nontransmitted BSSID proﬁle, the corresponding values are the element values of the transmitted BSSID.
   A non-PCP/non-AP STA derives its nontransmitted BSSID value according to 8.4.2.48 and 8.4.2.76.
  The Partial Virtual Bitmap ﬁeld in the transmitted BSSID Beacon frame or DMG Beacon frame shall indicate the presence or absence of trafﬁc to be delivered to all stations associated to a transmitted or nontransmitted BSSID. The first 2” bits of the bitmap are reserved for the indication of group addressed frames for the transmitted and all nontransmitted BSSIDs. The AID space is shared by all B355, and the lowest AID value that shall be assigned to a station is 2” [see 8.4.2.7).
  Operation in a non-DMG B35 is subject to the following additional rules. If the contention-free period is supported and if the CFPCount ofmore than one BSS becomes 0 in the same Beacon frame, the AP shall concatenate the contention-free periods of all CFPs that coincide and shall not transmit a CF-End or CF- End+Ack until the end of the concatenated CFP, indicated with a single CF-End or CF-End+Ack, if required. The CF Parameter Set in the transmitted BSSID contains times that are an aggregate ofCFP times ofthe nontransmitted BSSIDs.
      Multiple BSSID rate selection is deﬁned in 9.7.7.
 10.1.3.7 TSF timer accuracy Change 1410.13. 7 as ﬁrlllrws:
  Upon receiving a Beacon or a DMG Beacon or an Announce frame with a valid FCS and BSSID or SSID, as described in 10.1.3.5, a STA shall update its TSF timer according to the following algorithm:
  7 Non-DMG STA: The received timestamp value shall be adjusted by adding an amount equal to the receiving STA’s delay through its local PIIY components plus the time since the ﬁrst bit of the timestamp was received at the MAC/PIIY interface.
  7 DMG STA: The received timestamp value shall be adjusted by adding an amount equal to the receivin STA’s delav throu h its local PHY components plus the time since the last data 5 mbol of the PLCP header excluding anv uard interval was received as indicated bv PIIY7RXSTART.ind.
  In the case ofan infrastructure BSS or a PBSS, the STA’s TSF timer shall then be set to the adjusted value of the timestamp. In the case of an IBSS, the STA’s TSF timer shall be set to the adjusted value ofthe received timestamp, if the adjusted value of the timestamp is later than the value of the STA’s TSF timer. The accuracy of the TSF timer shall be no worse than i 0.01%.
  When an STA is associated to a BSS with a nontransmitted BSSID, it shall use the TSF from the transmitted BSSID beacon frame.

To actively scan, the STA shall transmit Probe request frames containing the desired SSID or one or more SSID List elements but a DMG STA might also have to transmit DMG Beacon frames or perfomi beamfonnin trainin prior to the transmission ofProbe Re ]uest frames. When the SSID List element is present in the Probe Request frame, one or more of the SSID elements may include a wildcard SSID (see 8.4.2.2). The exact procedure for detemiining the SSID or SSID List values in the MLME-SCAN.request primitive is not specified in this standard. When a STA scans for a BSS whose AP does not support the SSID List element, or for a BSS for which AP support ofthe SSID List element is unknown, the SSID element with an SSID or wildcard SSID shall be included in the MLME-SCAN.request primitive.

A result of the procedures deﬁned in this subclause is that in each infrastructure BSS except in DMG BSSs and IBSS, there is at least one STA that is awake at any given time to receive and respond to probe requests. In an MBSS, STAs might not be awake at any given time to respond to probe reques . In an infrastructure BSS or in an IBSS, a STA that sent a Beacon frame shall remain in the Awake state and shall respond to probe requests, subject to criteria in the next paragraph, until a Beacon frame with the current BSSID is received.

10.1.4.4.2 Initializing a DMG BSS  Prior to choosing a suitable operating channel and starting a BSS. the SME ofa DMG STA should perform a channel scan to ascertain the quality of each channel that the STA supports. The rules for choosing a suitable operating channel are implementation speciﬁc and might be subject to regulatory requirements.
  Upon receipt ofan MLME-START.request primitive from the SME, the MAC entity ofthe DMG STA shall try to start a BSS. The DMG STA may listen for a duration of aMinChannelTime, the listening duration, in the channel speciﬁed by the SME in the request. Ifthe DMG STA determines the channel is suitable for BSS operation at the end of this listening duration, the DMG STA initializes the BSS by commencing transmission of DMG Beacon frames according to 10.1.3.2a in the case ofa PBSS or an infrastructure BSS and according to 10. 3 3 in the case of an IBSS. If PCP/AP clustering is in use on the selected channel, the DMG Beacon transmission by a PCP/AP commences following the additional rules described in 9.34.

The Power Management bit in the Frame Control ﬁeld of the frame sent by the STA in this exchange indicates the Power Management mode that the STAs coordinated by the MM-SME and advertised in the MMS element sent by the STA shall adopt upon successful completion of the entire frame exchange. To change the Power Management mode of the coordinated STA, the frame may be sent using any ofthe MMSLs within the MMSL cluster established with the AP.

  10.2.5 Power management in a PBSS and DMG infrastructure BSS  10.2.5.1 General  To enable non-PCP/non-AP STAs and PCPs to sleep for one or more beacon intervals or part ofa beacon interval, a non-PCP/non-AP STA power save mechanism and a PCP power save mechanism are defined in this subclause.
  Non-PCP/non-AP STA power save mode, as described in 10.2.5.2, allows a non-PCP/non-AP STA to sleep at intervals negotiated with the PCP/AP. Each non-PCP/non-AP STA can choose an independent wakeup schedule that fits its own power consumption and traffic delivery requirements.
  PCP Power Save (PPS) mode, as described in 10.2.5.3, allows a PCP to sleep at intervals to minimize the energy consumption. The PCP operating in PPS mode can choose an independent wakeup schedule to sleep for one or more consecutive beacon intervals and does not transmit DMG Beacons during this time.
  The Wakeup Schedule element is used to schedule the wakeup and sleeping ofSTAs. The Wakeup Schedule element deﬁnes two types of beacon intervals:
  7 Doze Bl: a beacon interval that is explicitly deﬁned as a Doze B1 in the last, if any, Wakeup Schedule element successfully negotiated with the PCP/AP in the case of non-PCP/non-AP power save mode or transmitted by the PCP in the case of PCP power save mode.
   7 Awake BI: a beacon interval that is not deﬁned as a Doze B1.
   A STA may operate in one oftwo power states:
  7 Awake: STA is fully powered.
  7 Doze: STA is not able to transmit or receive and consumes very low power.
      

page 373
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  The manner in which a STA transitions between these two power states shall be determined by the STA’s Power Management mode:
  7 Active mode: A STA is in the Awake state, except that the STA can switch to Doze state ill an Awake BI when the STA is allowed to doze as indicated in Table lO-la.
  7 Power Save (PS) mode: A STA alternates between the Awake and the Doze states, as detennined by the rules deﬁned in this subclause.
  A PCP/AP keeps track of the wakeup schedules of all associated non-PCP/non-AP STAs. Each STA delivers traffic to a peer STA only when the peer STA is in Awake state.
  Art AP shall buffer MPDUs addressed to non-AP STAs in Doze state. The buffered data shall be transmitted only at designated times (10.2.5.2). A non-AP STA shall defer delivering ofMPDUs addressed to other non- AP STA ill Doze state. The MPDUs shall be transmitted only at designated times (10.2.5.2).
  Ifa PCP sets the BSS Type ﬁeld within a transmitted DMG Beacon frame to PBSS or the PCP/AP includes a Nontransmitted BSSID Capability element ill a transmitted DMG Beacon, Announce, or Probe Response frames and the BSS Type ﬁeld within the Nontranslnitted BSSID Capability element is equal to PBSS, then the PCP/AP shall follow the PCP power management rules described in 10.2.5.3 if the PCP/AP chooses to employ power management.
  A PCP/AP may include an Antenna Sector ID Pattern element in Power Save Conﬁguration Response and Probe Response frames transmitted to a non-PCP/non-AP STA. If a non-PCP/non-AP STA uses the information contained in the Antenna Sector ID Pattenl element received from its PCP/AP, then during the BTI of an Awake Bl, the STA might stay awakejust to receive DMG Beacon frames transmitted through speciﬁc DMG antenna and sector and switch to Doze state during other periods in the BTI.

  When a non-PCP/non-AP STA that has not set up a wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP enters PS mode, every beacon interval shall be an Awake BI for that STA. A non-PCP/non-AP STA that has not set up a wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP and that is in PS mode shall be awake during any allocated SP for which the STA is either the source DMG STA or destination DMG STA during an Awake BI.

lEEE  10.2.5.2.3 Power management mode operation of a non-PCPInon-AP STA with a wakeup schedule  To transition from Active mode to PS mode, a non-PCP/non-AP STA that is associated with a PCP/AP shall establish a wakeup schedule with the PCP/AP. A wakeup schedule (WS) is established with the PCP/AP following the successful transmission ofa PSC-REQ frame to the PCP/AP with the DPM ﬁeld set to l and an acknowledged receipt of the corresponding PSC-RSP from the PCP/AP provided that the PSC-RSP contained a status code indicating success. After receiving a PSC-RSP frame from the PCP/AP with a status code indicating success and responding with an acknowledgment, the STA switches to the PS mode at the instant speciﬁed by the BI Start Time ﬁeld ofthe Wakeup Schedule element transmitted to the PCP/AP and follows the WS established with the PCP/AP.
  If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has not established a pseudo-static SP with the PCP/AP, a WS element shall be included in any PSC-REQ frame that the STA transmits to the PCP/AP as an explicit request for a wakeup schedule. If the PCP/AP accepts the proposed WS, it shall reply with a PSC-RSP frame indicating a status code of SUCCESS. Otherwise, it shall respond with a PSC-RSP frame with a nonzero status code indicating the reason for rejecting the request. The PCP/AP may suggest an alternative schedule in the PSC-RSP frame and set the status code to REJECTiwlTILSCHEDULE. If the STA accepts the altemative schedule, it shall include this WS in a subsequently transmitted PSC-REQ frame. Ifthe non-PCP/ non-AP STA does not accept the alternative schedule, it shall not send a PSC-REQ frame for dotl 1PSRequestSuspensionInterval beacon intervals following the receipt ofthe PSC-RSP frame.
  NOTEil’roviding recommended schedules enables the PCP’AP to align sleep intervals from different non-PCP’non- AP STAs.
  If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has established a pseudo-static SP schedule with the PCP/AP, it may omit the WS in the PSC-REQ frames that it sends to the PCP/AP. In this case, all outstanding pseudo-static SPs for the non-PCP/non-AP STA become an implicit WS request. When no WS element is speciﬁed in a PSC- REQ, the PCP/AP shall reply with a PSC-RSP frame indicating a status code ofSUCCESS and shall adopt all outstanding pseudo-static service period schedules (9.33.6.4) as the wakeup schedule for that STA.
  Ifa non-PCP/non-AP STA has explicitly established a WS with the PCP/AP and the non-PCP/non-AP STA is in PS mode, the non-PCP/non-AP STA shall have m successive Awake BIs repeating every n beacon interval, where n is the value ofthe Sleep Cycle field of the WS element contained in the PSC-RSP frame received from the PCP/AP during the frame exchange that established the WS, and m is the value of the Number of Awake/Doze BIs field in that PSC-RSP frame. The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall be awake during allocated SPs in which it is either the source or destination DMG STA during each Awake BI.
  Ifa non-PCP/non-AP STA has implicitly established a WS with the PCP/AP and the non-PCP/non-AP STA is in PS mode, every beacon interval that includes an SP for which the non-PCP/non-AP STA is either the source or the destination shall be an Awake BI for the non-PCP/non-AP STA. The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall be awake during the Awake Window within the CBAPs and during allocated SPs in which it is either the source or destination DMG STA during each ofits Awake BIs.
  The WS established by a non-PCP/non-AP STA might contain one part that is explicitly negotiated with the PCP/AP and another part that is inferred from the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s pseudo-static SPs. The portion of the WS that is explicitly negotiated between the non-PCP/non-AP STA and the PCP/AP remains valid until the non-PCP/non-AP STA updates or deletes the explicit portion ofthe WS through a successful PSC-REQ/ PSC-RSP exchange or until the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s association with the PCP/AP times out. The portion of the WS that is inferred from the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s pseudo-static SPs changes with the changing allocation of the non-PCP/non-AP STA’s pseudo-static SPs and is deleted when the association with the PCP/AP times out or when an explicit deletion request for the SP is successful.

Upon receiving the unsolicited PSC-RSP frame meeting these conditions, the non-PCP/non-AP STA shall switch to Active mode.
  10.2.5.2.4 Power management mode operation of a non-PCPInon-AP STA with or without a wakeup schedule  A non-PCP/non-AP STA in PS mode shall stay awake for dotl lMinBIIIDuration starting from the beginning of each Awake BI and may switch to the Doze state after the expiration of this time. The only exception is when the Power Save Conﬁguration Response or Probe Response frame received from the PCP/ AP includes an Antenna Sector ID Pattern element, in which case the non-PCP/non-AP STA may use the Antenna Sector ID Pattern element to receive DMG Beacon frames transmitted through a speciﬁc DMG antenna and sector, and may switch to Doze state during other periods in the ET].
  A PCP/AP shall transmit SP allocation announcements for STAs in PS mode during each of the STAs’ Awake Bls and may transmit those SP allocation announcements in other beacon intervals. New SPs shall be allocated to begin either within or after the later Awake BI ofthe source DMG STA and destination DMG STA of the SP.
  To transition from PS mode to Active mode, a non-PCP/non-AP STA that has an established WS with the PCP/AP shall send a PSC-REQ frame with the DPM ﬁeld set to 0 to the PCP/AP and enter Active mode following the reception ofthe ACK response. The PCP/AP shall not send a PSC-RSP frame ifthe DPM ﬁeld is 0 in the PSC-REQ frame.
  In order for a STA to learn the WS of another STA within the BSS, the STA may send an Information Request frame to the other STA or to the PCP/AP as deﬁned in 10.29. 1.
  If the Infomiation Request frame is transmitted to the PCP/AP and the STA indicated in the Infomiation Request’s Subject Address ﬁeld does not have an established WS with the PCP/AP, the PCP/AP shall set the length of the Wakeup Schedule element to O in the Infomiation Response frame. Every time the STA indicated in the Information Request’s Subject Address ﬁeld changes its WS with the PCP/AP, the PCP/AP shall inform the STA that requested the information by transmitting an unsolicited Information Response frame with the updated Wakeup Schedule element.
  There might be one or more CBAPs in a beacon interval. An Awake window is present within the ﬁrst CBAP of a beacon interval if the Awake Window ﬁeld in the Awake Window element (8.4.2.139) has a value that is nonzero. The Awake window starts from the beginning of the ﬁrst CBAP and has a duration that is deﬁned by the value ofthe Awake Window ﬁeld in the Awake Window element. During the Awake window, a STA shall transmit only ATIM frames. A DMG STA in PS mode shall be in the Awake state during each Awake window that lies within each Awake BI for that STA.
  Group addressed MSDUs, individually addressed MSDUs and MMPDUs that are to be transmitted to a STA that is in PS mode are ﬁrst announced through ATIM frames during the Awake window. A STA in PS mode that is awake during an Awake window shall listen for these announcements to determine if it needs to remain in the Awake state. If during the Awake window the STA does not receive or transmit an ATIM frame with BSSID equal to the BSSID ofthe BSS the STA is a member, then it may enter the Doze state at the end of the Awake window. If a STA receives an ATIM frame during the Awake Window, it shall acknowledge the ATIM frame. Any two STAs that successfully complete an ATIM frame exchange with each other during the Awake Window become peer STAs. Ifa STA receives or transmits an ATIM frame during the Awake Window, it shall be awake during the CBAP(s) within the current beacon interval that have the source AID or destination AID described by the ATIM frame to wait for the announced MSDU(s) and/or MMPDU(s) to be received and/or to transmit announced MSDU(s) and/or MMPDU(s).

  10.2.5.3 PCP Power management mode  A PCP in PPS mode (PPS PCP) may enter the Doze state for one or more consecutive beacon intervals in order to minimize its energy consumption. Figure 10-5b illustrates a ﬁnite state machine that shows the state transition of the PCP power management mode.

The Wakeup Schedule element shall be transmitted at least dotl lMaxLostBeacons times before the PCP goes into PS mode. The PCP enters PS mode at the instant speciﬁed by the value of the BI Start Time ﬁeld of the corresponding Wakeup Schedule element. In order to transition from PS mode to active mode, the PCP shall stop including Wakeup Schedule elements in DMG Beacon and Announce frames.
   In a PCP Doze BI, the PCP shall transmit an Announce frame during the ATI to each associated STA.
  The PCP may include in the Extended Schedule element the schedule for the beacon intervals during the PCP Doze Bls. The PCP may schedule a SP or CBAP within a Doze BI by setting the Allocation Stan ﬁeld of the new SP or CBAP in the Extended Schedule element to a value within a Doze BI. If the Extended Schedule element is transmitted, the PCP shall transmit it at least dotllMaxLostBeacons times before the PPS PCP enters the Doze state.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  The PCP shall check that the schedule of pseudo-static allocations transmitted in the last Extended Schedule element before the PCP entered PS mode is valid during the PCP Doze BIs. Thus, a STA participating in such a pseudo-static allocation assumes that the allocation is present during the following consecutive PCP Doze BIs.
  The PCP may enter and remain in the Doze state for any portion ofan SP ifit is not a source or a destination of the SP. The PCP shall remain in the Awake state for any portion of a truncatable or extendable SP (8.4.2.134). The availability ofthe PCP during a CBAP in the Awake BI shall be announced by setting the PCP Active subﬁeld within the Allocation Control ﬁeld to one for a CBAP allocation made through the Extended Schedule element.
  Figure 10-5c shows an example of the basic operation ofa PCP in PPS mode when the PCP sleep interval equals one beacon interval (i.e., PCP sleeps every other beacon interval) and the PCP sleep interval starts right alter the ﬁrst beacon interval. In this example, the ﬁrst beacon interval and the second beacon interval have the same schedule, but the third beacon interval and the fourth beacon interval have different schedules. The first beacon interval is the Awake BI in which the PPS PCP is in the Awake state to serve non-PCP STAs. In the ﬁrst beacon interval, the PCP transmits the Extended Schedule element for the current beacon interval with the pseudo-static subﬁeld set to l for all allocations within the Extended Schedule element to indicate that the schedule ofthe ﬁrst beacon interval also applies to the second beacon interval. In addition, the PCP transmits the Wakeup Schedule element with the information of the start time and the length ofthe PCP sleep interval, and the STA Availability element to indicate the availability of the PCP for the CBAP of the Awake BI. Following the CBAP of the ﬁrst beacon interval, the PCP enters the Doze state and sleeps for more than one beacon interval. The PCP switches from the Doze state to the Awake state after sleeping through the remainder of the ﬁrst beacon interval and through the entire second beacon interval, which is the start of the third beacon interval in Figure 10-5c. Since in this example the schedule of the third beacon interval and the fourth beacon interval are different, the PCP transmits the Extended Schedule element containing the individual allocations for the third beacon interval and fourth beacon interval. The PCP enters the Doze state after it completes all exchanges in the third beacon interval and wakes up at the start ofthe ﬁfth beacon interval.

  The current state existing between the transmitter and receiver STAs detemiines the IEEE 802.11 frame types that may be exchanged between that pair of STAs (see Clause 8). A unique state exists for each pair of transmitter and receiver STAs. The allowed frame types are grouped into classes, and the classes correspond to the STA state. In State 1, only Class 1 frames are allowed. In State 2, either Class 1 or Class 2 frames are allowed. In State 3 and State 4, all frames are allowed (Classes 1, 2, and 3).
   In the deﬁnition of frame classes the following terms are used:
     : Within an infrastructure 835' both the transmitting STA and the recinient STA participate in the same infrastructure BSS  Within a PBSS: both the transmittin STA and the recinient STA narticinate in the same PBSS Within an [855' both the transmitting STA and the recinient STA narticinate in the same IBSS  : dot!

      : STA A is associated with STA B and either STA A or STA B is an AP.
  : STA A receives a frame with the value of its TA field equal to the MAC address of STA B and with the value of its BSSID ﬁeld Canal to the BSSID of the B53 with which STA A is associated.
  7 STA A receives an Infonnation Resnonse frame from the AP with which it is associated containin an explicit indication that STA B is a member ofthe BSS with which STA A is associated.
   STA A narticinates in the same PBSS as STA B if at least one ofthe followin conditions is met:
  STA A is associated with STA B and either STA A or STA B is a PCP.
  STA A receives a frame with the value of its TA field equal to the MAC address of STA B and with the value of its BSSID field equal to the BSSID of the PBSS that STA A has ioined or started.
  7 STA A receives a frame i.e. an Information Resnonse frame from its PCP containing an exnlicit indication that STA B is a member of the PBSS that STA A has ioined.
     STA A narticinates in the same IBSS as STA B if STA A receives a frame with the value of its TA ﬁeld equal to the MAC address of STA B and with the value of its BSSID field equal to the BSSID of the IBSS   that STA A has ined or started.

10.3.5.1 General  Subclause 10.3.5 describes the procedures used for IEEE 802.11 association, reassociation, and disassociation.
   The states used in this description are defined in 10.3.1.
  Successful association enables a STA to exchange Class 3 frames. Successful association sets the STA’s state to State 3 or State 4.
  Successful reassociation enables a STA to exchange Class 3 frames. Unsuccessful reassociation when not in State 1 leaves the STA’s state unchanged (with respect to the ﬂAP that was sent the Reassociation Request (which may be the current STA)). Successful reassociation sets the STA’s state to State 3 or State 4 (with respect to the HAP that wal ent the Reassociation Request). Successful reassociation when not in State 1 sets the STA’s state to State 2 (with respect to the current PCP/AP, ifthis is not the HAP that was sent the Reassociation Request). Reassociation shall be performed only if the originating STA is already associated in the same ESS.
        Disassociation notification when not in State 1 sets the STA’s state to State 2. The STA shall become associated again prior to sending Class 3 frames. A STA may disassociate a peer STA at any time, for any reason.
  If non-DMG STA A in an infrastructure BSS receives a Class 3 frame from STA B that is authenticated but not associated with STA A (i.e., the state for STA B is State 2), STA A shall discard the frame. Ifthe frame has an individual address in the Address 1 field, the MLME of STA A shall send a Disassociation frame to STA B.
  If DMG STA A in an infrastructure BSS receives a Class 3 frame from STA B that is not associated with STA A (Le. the state for STA B is State 2) STA A shall discard the frame. Ifthe frame has an individual address in the Address 1 field the MLME of STA A shall send a Dis sociation frame to STA B.
  If an MM-SME coordinated STA receives an Association Response frame with a result code equal to SUCCESS and with the value of the Single AID field within MMS element equal to 1 then 7 For each ofits MAC entities advertised within the MMS element and for which dotl IRSNAEnabled is true the state is set to State 3. Progress from State 3 to State 4 occurs independent] in each such MAC en ity  7 For each 0 ts MAC entities advertised within the MMS element and for which dotl IRSNAEnabled is false the state is set to State 4.
        If the MM-SME coordinated STA in State 3 is a igned an AID for only the MAC entity identiﬁed by the RA ﬁeld of the Association Response with result code equal to SUCCESS the MM-SME ma repeat the association procedure for any other MAC entit coordinated by the MM-SME.
  Association is not applicable in an IBSS. In an infrastructure BSS, association is required. In a PBSS association is optional. APs do not initiate association.

        Upon receipt of an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall associate with an PCP/AP using the following procedure:
  a) Ifthe state for the AP is State 1, the MLME shall inform the SME of the failure ofthe association by iss ing an MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm primitive, and this procedure ends.
  b) The MLME shall transmit an Association Request frame to the EAR. If the MLME- ASSOCIATE.request primitive contained an RSNE with only one pairw se cipher suite and only one authenticated key suite, this RSNE shall be included in the Association Request frame. If the MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive contained the EmergencyServices parameter set to true, an Interworking element with the UESA ﬁeld set to 1 shall be included in the Association Request frame.
  c) If an Association Response frame is received with a status code ofSuccessful, the state for the Q AP shall be set to State 4 or State 3 ifRSNA Establishment is required.

The status code returned in the Association Response frame indicates the cause of the failed association attempt. Any misconfiguration or parameter mismatch, e.g., data rates required as basic rates that the STA did not indicate as supported in the STA’s Supported Rates element, shall be corrected before the SME issues an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same ﬂ AP. If the status code indicates the association failed because of a reason that is not related to configuration (e.g., the ﬂAP is unable to support additional associations) and the Association Response frame does not include a Timeout Interval element with Timeout Interval Type equal to 3, the SME shall not issue an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same ﬂAP until a period of at least 2 s has elapsed. If the status code indicates the association failed and the Association Response frame contains a Timeout Interval element with Timeout Interval Type equal to 3, the SME shall not issue an MLME-ASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same ﬂAP until the period specified in the Timeout Interval element has elapsed.

  Upon receiving an MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication primitive, when management frame protection is not in use, the SME shall delete any PTKSA and temporal keys held for communication with the STA by using the MLME-DELETEKEYS.request primitive (see 11.5.15).
  In an RSNA, the PCP/AP shall check the values received in the RSNE to see whether the values received match the PCP/Al’s security policy. Ifnot, the association shall not be accepted.
  If the ﬂAP’s state for the non-PCP/non-AP STA is State 4, the ﬂAP has a valid security association for the non-PCP/non-AP STA and has negotiated management frame protection with the non-PCP/non-AP STA, and an earlier, timed-out SA Query procedure with the non-PCP/non-AP STA has not allowed a new association process to be started without an additional SA Query procedure, then  1) The SME shall reject the Association Request by generating an MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive with ResultCode “Association request rejected temporarily; try again later."  2) The SME shall not modify any association state for the non-PCP/non-AP STA and shall include in the MLME-ASSOCIATE.response primitive a Timeout Interval element with Timeout interval type set to 3 [Association Comeback time), specifying a comeback time when the ﬂAP would be ready to accept an association with this STA.

           Upon receipt of an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive that is part of an on-channel tunneling [see 1032.4) a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall follow the rules in 1032.4 in addition to the reassociation   procedures described below.
        Upon receipt of an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall reassociate with a PCP/AP using the following procedure:
  a) If the STA is not associated in the same ESS or the state for the new AP is State 1, the MLME shall inform the SME of the failure of the reassociation by issuing an MLME-REASSOCIATEconﬁrm primitive, and this procedure ends.
  b) The MLME shall transmit a Reassociation Request frame to the new ﬂAP. If the MLME- REASSOCIATE.request primitive contained an RSNE with only one pairwise cipher suite and only one authenticated key suite, this RSNE shall be included in the Reassociation Request frame. If the MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive contained the EmergencyServices parameter set to true, an Interworking element with the UESA freld set to 1 shall be included in the Reassociation Request frame.
  c) Ifa Reassociation Response frame is received with a status code of Successful, the state variable for the new ﬂAP shall be set to State 4 or to State 3 if RSNA establishment is required and the FT Protocol is not used with respect to the new @AP and, unless the old @AP and new ﬂAP are the same, to State 2 with respect to the old ﬂAP, and the MLME shall issue an MLME- REASSOCIATE.conﬁrm primitive to inform the SME of the successful completion of the reassociation.
  d) An MM-SME coordinated STA that receives a Reassociation Response frame with a status code of Successful containing an MLME element with the Single AID freld equal to 1 all the STAs coordinated by the MM-SME are reassociated with the PCP/AP (i.e. shall be set to State 4 or State 3 ifRSNA Estab men re uired .
  e) d-Hf a Reassociation Response frame is received with a status code other than Successful or the ReassociateFailureTimeout expires,                1) Except when the association is part ofa fast BSS transition, the state for the PCP/AP shall be set to State 2 with respect to the new PCP/AP.
  2) The MLME shall issue an MLME-REASSOCIATEconﬁnn primitive to inform the SME of the failure of the reassociation. The ResultCode retumed in the MLME- REASSOCIATE.conﬁmr primitive indicates the cause of the failed reassociation attempt. Any misconfrguration or parameter mismatch, e.g., data rates required as basic rates that the STA did not indicate as supported in the STA’s Supported Rates element, shall be corrected before the SME issues an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same ﬂAP. If the status code indicates the reassociation failed because of a reason that is not related to configuration (e.g., the EAR is unable to support additional associations) and the Reassociation Response frame does not include a Timeout Interval element with Timeout Interval Type equal to 3, the SME shall not issue an MLME-REASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same ﬂAP until a period ofat least 2 s has elapsed. Ifthe status code indicates the reassociation failed and the Reassociation Response frame contains a Timeout Interval element with Timeout Interval Type equal to 3, the SME shall not issue an MLME- REASSOCIATE.request primitive for the same @AP until the period specified in the Timeout Interval element has elapsed.

  10.4 TS operation  10.4.1 Introduction   Change 10.4.1 uxﬂllluwx:
   There are three types oftrafﬁc Speciﬁcations: the TSPEC the DMG TSPEC and the PTP TSPEC.
  A TSPEC describes the trafﬁc characteristics and the QoS requirements ofa TS. The main purpose of the TSPEC is to reserve resources within the IIC and, in the case of IICCA and IIEMM access policies, to modify the IIC’s scheduling behavior. It also allows other parameters to be speciﬁed that are associated with the TS, such as a trafﬁc classiﬁer and acknowledgment policy.
  The DMG TSPEC (8.4.2.136) describes an allocation (also known as DMG allocation) within either a PBSS or a DMG infrastructure BSS. The purpose ofthe DMG TSPEC is to create or modify an allocation for the transm sion of frames between DMG STAs that are members of a PBSS or that are members of an   infrastmcture BSS 9.33.6 .
  When transmitted between DMG STAs of a PBSS or DMG STAs of an infrastructure BSS the TSPEC deﬁned in 8.4.2.32 is used to create or modif a TS between members. When transmitted between DMG STAs of a PBSS or between DMG STAs of an infrastructure BSS the TSPEC is referred to as a PTP TSPEC.
  In a DMG BSS a TSPEC includes parameters that are associated with the TS such as maximum MSDU size dela bound and optionally the allocation carrvin the TS. A single allocation can can multiple TSs.
Each TS ' arried in one allocation except when : The TS has an access polic of EDCA where it can use all CBAP allocations with Source AID equal to the broadcast AID all CBAP allocations with Source AID matching the source STA of the TS and all CBAP allocations with Destination AID matching the destination STA ofthe TS' or  7 The TS has an access policy of SEMM where it can use exactl one SP allocation as well as all CBAP allocations with Source AID equal to the broadcast AID all CBAP allocations with Source AID matching the source STA ofthe TS and all CBAP allocations with Destination AID matchin the destination STA ofthe TS.
                    A TS may have one or more TCLAS (within the discretion of the STA that sets up the stream) associated with it. The DMG STA or AP uses the parameters in the TCLAS elements to filter the MSDUs belonging to this TS for delivery as part of the TS. An Intra-Access Category Priority element may be associated with a TS by the inclusion of an Intra-Access Category Priority element in an ADDTS Request frame. The User Priority subﬁeld ofthe Intra-Access Category Priority element shall be set to the same UP as speciﬁed in the      

page 394
IEEE  User Priority subfield of the TS Info ﬁeld. IfdotllAltemateEDCAActivated is true, the Alternate Queue subﬁeld is used to select the appropriate EDCA transmit queue when the Access Policy subfield of the TS Info ﬁeld in tlie TSPEC is EDCA or IIEMM. When an Intra-Access Category Priority element is associated with a TS, the Drop Eligibility subﬁeld is used to indicate the drop eligibility ofthe MSDUs oftliis TS.
  TS may have zero or one Expedited Bandwidth Request (EBR) element associated with it. An AP uses the parameters in the EBR to understand the precedence level requested by a non-AP STA (see V5.4). For example, the precedence level may be used to convey to the AP that the requested TS is for the purposes of placing an emergency call. Support for precedence levels greater than 18 is optional for STAs.
  TSPEC, PTP TSPEC optional TCLAS, optional EBR, and optional Intra-Access Category Priority elements are transported on the air by the ADDTS Request frame and the ADDTS Response frame and across the MLME SAP by the MLME-ADDTS primitives. In addition, a TS could be created ifa STA sends a resource request to an ﬂAP prior to initiating a transition to that HAP as art of erfomiin FST 10.32 or in the Reassociation Request frame to that HAP.
     DMG TSPEC is transported over the air within the DMG ADDTS and across the MLME SAP b the MLME-ADDTS primitives.
  Following a successful negotiation, a TS is created, identiﬁed within the non-AP STA by its TSID and direction, and identiﬁed within the IIC by a combination ofTSID, direction, and STA address.
  Following a successful negotiation ofa DMG TSPEC in a PBSS or in a DMG infrastnicture BSS a new allocation is created or an existin allocation is modiﬁed. Within a PBSS or infrastructure BSS each allocation is uniquely identiﬁed by a combination of Allocation ID source AID and destination AID.
  Following a successful iie otiation ofa PTP TSPEC or a TSPEC in a DMG BSS the frames correspondin to the FTP TSPEC or TSPEC are identiﬁed within the DMG STA b the combination of TSID requesting non-AP DMG STA address and responding non-AP DMG STA address and direction.
     It is always the responsibility ofthe non-AP STA to initiate the creation ofa TS regardless of its directionﬁ STA that is not a DMG STA shall not transmit a PTP TSPEC or a DMG TSPEC. A non-AP DMG STA that is not the source DMG STA ofa speciﬁc TS shall not initiate the exchange of a TSPEC to the AP DMG STA or PCP DMG STA to create that TS. Any non-AP DMG STA can issue a PTP TSPEC to any other non-AP DMG STA to create a TS.
  In the direct-link or TDLS direct-link case, it is the responsibility ofthe STA that is going to send the data to create the TS. In this case, the STA negotiates with the IIC to gain TXOPs that it uses to send the data. There is no negotiation between the originator and recipient STAs concerning the TS: the originator can discover the capabilities oftlie recipient (rates, BlockAck) using the DLS.
     In the case of trafﬁc relayed by an PCP/AP, the sending and receiving no CP/non-AP STAs may both create individual TSs for the traffic. In an infrastructure BSS aAny traffic classi ier created for the downlink TS applies equally regardless of whether the source is in the same BSS or reached through the DS.
     In a non-DMG infrastructure BSS aA non-AP STA may simultaneously support up to eight TSs from the IIC to itselfand up to eight TSs from itselfto otlier STAs, including the IIC. The actual number it supports may be less due to implementation restrictions.
     In a non-DMG infrastnicture BSS aAn IIC may simultaneously support up to eight downlink TSs and up to eight uplink TSs per associated STA. The actual number it supports may be less due to implementation restrictions.
         

page 395
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  Within a DMG BSS there ma be up to 16 TSs from a source DMG STA to a destination DMG STA. An additional 16 TSs may be created between the two DMG STAs by reversin the roles of source and destination. The actual number supported in an direction ma be less due to implementation restrictions in either the source or destination DMG STA.
           In a non-DMG BSS tIhe trafﬁc admitted in context of a TSPEC can be sent using EDCA, IICCA, or IIEMM. T is depends on the access policy set in the TS Into ﬁeld in tlie TSPEC. A TSPEC request may be set so that both IICCA and EDCA mechanisms (i.e., IIEMM) are used.
     In a DMG BSS the trafﬁc admitted in the context ofa PTP TSPEC or TSPEC is sent according to the access polic set in the TS Into ﬁeld oftlie PTP TSPEC or TSPEC respectively. Speciﬁcally the trafﬁc is sent during one or more CBAP allocations if the access polic is EDCA during an SP allocation if the access polic is SPCA and during one SP allocation as well as zero or more CBAP allocations ifthe access polic is SEMM.
              A DMG STA transmitting a DMG TSPEC shall set the LP SC Used subﬁeld within the DMG TSPEC to l to indicate that the low-power SC PIIY described in 21.7 is used during the allocation. All frames sent durin such an allocation shall use the low-power SC PIIY. The DMG STA shall set the LP SC Used snbﬁeld to l on] if the DMG STA identiﬁed in the Destination AID ﬁeld within the DMG TSPEC supports the low- power SC PIIY (8.4.2.1302). In all other cases the LP SC Used subﬁeld shall be set to 0.
                 When dot1lSSPNIntertaceActivated is true, TSPEC processing by the IIC may be subject to limitations received from the SSPN interface. The SSPN may limit access to certain QoS priorities, and further restrict the data rate and delay used with any priority.
  10.4.2 TSPEC Construction   Change theﬂrxt paragraph in 10.4.2 usfallaws:
  DMG TSPECs and TSPECs are constructed at the SME, from application requirements supplied via the SME, and with information speciﬁc to the MAC layer. Except as described in this subclause, there are no  normative requirements on how any TSPEC is to be generated. IIowever, N.3.2 describes parameter choice for the TSPEC. There are no nonnative requirements on how any DMG TSPEC is to be generated.
     10.4.3 TS life cycle Insert thefallawing paragraph after the third paragraph (“A TS may be established  ") 0f10.413:
  Unless stated otherwise, in a DMG BSS, the owner of an SP is the source DMG STA for that SP, and the owner ofa TXOP is the TXOP holder. A STA that owns an SP or a TXOP is said to have the ownership of the SP or the TXOP, respectively. The rules applicable to an SP or TXOP owner are deﬁned in 9.33 and 10.4.
   Change the raw sixth, seventh, and eighth [mragrllphx af10.4.3 uxfallaws:
  While the TS is active, the parameters of the TSPEC characterizing the TS or the parameters of the DMG TSPEC characterizing the allocation carrying the TS can be renegotiated, when the renegotiation is initiated by the non-AP STA. This negotiation might succeed, resulting in a change to the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC, or might fail, resulting in no change to the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC.
  An active TS becomes inactive following a TS deletion process initiated at either non-AP STA or IIC. It also becomes inactive following a TS timeout detected at the IIC, or if the IIC within an AP when dotllSSPNIntertaceActivated is true determines as deﬁned in 10.245 that the non-AP STA’s TS has exceeded the transmitted MSDU limit for the access category in which the TS was admitted. In a DMG BSS         

page 396
lEEE  a TS timeout is detected at a non-AP STA and causes the TS deletion process to be initiated at the non-AP STA. When an active TS becomes inactive, all the resources allocated for the TS are released.
     An active TS may become suspended if no activity is detected for a duration ofa suspension interval. Upon detection of activity, the TS may be reinstated. While the TS is in the suspended state, the IIC shall not reclaim the resources assigned to the TS. In a DMG BSS a TS in which both the source and destination are no CP/no P STAs s all not be sus ended.

The SME generates an MLME- ADDTS.request primitive containing a TSPEC or DMG TSPEC. A TSPEC or DMG TSPEC may also be generated autonomoust by the MAC without any initiation by the SME. IIowever, ifa TSPEC or DMG TSPEC is generated subsequently by the SME and the responding MLME-ADDTSconﬁmi primitive contains ResultCode=SUCCESS, the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC containing the same TSID generated autonomously by the MAC shall be overridden. If one or more TSPECs or DMG TSPECs are initiated by the SME, the autonomous TSPEC or DMG TSPEC shall be terminated.
     The STA’s MLME transmits the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC in an ADDTS Request frame to the IIC/non-AP ﬂ and starts a response timer called ADDTS timer of duration dotl lADDTSResponseTimeout. If the non-AP STA’s MLME is in power save mode the STA shall include its Wakeup Schedule element in the ADDTS Request frame variant and in the DMG ADDTS Request frame variant.
           The IIC/non-AP’s MLME receives this management frame and generates an MLME-ADDTS.indication primitive to its SME containing the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC.
     The SME in the IIC/non-AP STA decides whether to admit the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC with its associated TCLAS element[s) (if present) and TCLAS processing element (if present), as speciﬁed, refuse the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC, or not admit but suggest an alternative TSPEC or TCLAS element(s) or TCLAS processing element or DMG TSPEC.
  If the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC is received from a non-AP STA by an AP when dotl ISSPNInterfaceActivated is true, the IIC shall use the permissions stored in dotl l InterworkingEntry for that STA in the decision to admit or deny the request (see 10.24.53). The SME then generates an MLME-ADDTS.response primitive containing the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC, zero or more TCLAS element(s) [only if present in the request) and TCLAS processing element (only if present in the request), and a ResultCode value. The contents of the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC ﬁeld, TCLAS element(s) (ifpresent), TCLAS processing element (if present), and ResultCode ﬁeld contain values speciﬁed in 6.3.26.5.2. The SME may include fewer TCLAS elements in the MLME-ADDTS.response primitive than were present in the request; when the SME‘s response includes a single TCLAS element, it shall not include a TCLAS processing element. If the SME changes a TCLAS element’s Classiﬁer Type ﬁeld in the MLME- ADDTS.response primitive but is unable to suggest a value for the Classiﬁer Mask ﬁeld, it shall set that ﬁeld to 0. Ifthe SME changes a TCLAS element’s Classiﬁer Type ﬁeld or Classiﬁer Mask ﬁeld in the MLME- ADDTS.response primitive but is unable to suggest values for one or more Classiﬁer Parameter subﬁelds, it shall set those subﬁelds to 0.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  When the IIC in an AP that has dotl lSSPNIntertaceActivated equal to true receives a TSPEC, the AP shall inspect it to determine the requested access policy, user priority, and mean data rate as follows:
  a) The access category shall be determined from the user priority according to Table 9-1. For a TS to be admitted when the requested access policy is EDCA, both ofthe following shall be true:
  1) The ﬁeld corresponding to this access category in dotl lNonAPStationAuthAccessCategories from the non-AP STA’s dotl lInterworkingEntry is equal to l.
  2) The sum of the mean data rate of all the requesting STA’s active TSs in this access category plus the mean data rate in the TSPEC is less than or equal to the non-AP STA’s dotl lInterworkingEntry for dotl lNonAPStationAuthMaxVoiceRate, dotllNonAPStationAuthMaxVideoRate, dotllNonAPStationAuthMaxBestEffortRate, or dotl lNonAPStationAuthMaxBackgroundRate depending on whether the derived access category is AC7VO, AC7VI, AC7BE or AC7BK, respectively.
  b) For a TS to be admitted when the requested access policy is IICCA, all of the following shall be true:
   1) The doll lNonAPStationAuthIICCAIIEMM value is true.
  2) The sum of the mean data rate of all the requesting STA’s active TSs having access policy set to IICCA plus the mean data rate in the TSPEC is less than or equal to dotl lNonAPStationAuthMaxlICCAIIEMMRate in the non-AP STA’s dotl lInterworkingEntry.
  3) The delay bound that will be provided by the IIC in the TSPEC response is less than or equal to dotl lNonAPStationAuthIICCAIIEMMDelay in the non-AP STA’s dotl llnterworkingEntry.
  If the DMG TSPEC is admitted the PCP/AP shall set the ResultCode to SUCCESSiSTAilNiDOZEiMODE if the STA identiﬁed b destination AID is in power save mode and shall include in the ADDTS Response frame the Wakenn Schedule element ofthe destination DMG STA if one is established. In this case the PCP/AP should defer includin the TS schedule in the Extended Schedule element until both source DMG STA and destination DMG STA are in active mode.
  The IIC/non-AP’s MLME transmits an ADDTS Response frame containing this TSPEC or DMG TSPEC and status. The encoding of the ResultCode values to Status Code ﬁeld values is deﬁned in Table 831$ PCP/AP shall transmit the ADDTS Response frame to the STAs identiﬁed as source and destination AID of the DMG TSPEC contained in the ADDTS Request frame if the ADDTS Request it is sent bv a non-PCP/ non-AP STA. If the ResultCode is SUCCESS the PCP/AP shall announce the creation of the allocation b setting the Allocation ID ﬁeld in the TSPEC element sent in the ADDTS Response frame to a nonzero value and also b includin the allocation schedule in the Extended Schedule element transmitted in the DMG Beacon frame or Announce frame.
  The STA’s MLME receives this management frame and cancels its ADDTS timer. It generates an MLME- ADDTS.confinn primitive to its SME containing the TSPEC or DMG TSPEC and status.
  The SME decides whether the response meets its needs. How it does this is beyond the scope of this standard. A SME receiving a modiﬁed TCLAS element having a Classiﬁer Mask ﬁeld equal to 0 or Classiﬁer Parameter subﬁelds equal to 0 should regard these values as meaning that no suggested value has been provided by the IIC.
   7 If the result code is SUCCESS, the TS enters into an active state.
  7 Ifthe result code is REJECTEDiwlTILSUGGESTEDiBssiTRANSITION, the non-AP STA may try to transition to other BSSs. In the case that the non-AP STA is recommended to transition to other BSSs, it should do so according to the process deﬁned in 1023.6. Once the transition is completed, it should proceed with a TS setup process with the new IIC.
  7 Otherwise, the whole process can be repeated using the same TSID and direction, a modified TSPEC or DMG TSPEC, optional TCLAS element(s), and an optional TCLAS processing element

IEEE  until the SME decides that the granted medium time is adequate or inadequate and cannot be improved.
   The above rules also apply to the negotiation of the FTP TSPEC and to the negotiation ofthe DMG TSPEC.
     The parameters that are set for a TS may be renegotiated in a similar manner, when such a request is generated by the SME through ADDTS.request primitive. When a request for the modiﬁcation of the TS parameters is accepted by the IIC, it shall reset both the suspension interval and the inactivity interval timers.
  When a request for the modification of the TS parameters is accepted b a non-AP STA it shall reset the inactivity interval timers.
     If the “Cm grants medium time for an ADDTS Request frame with the Ack Policy subﬁeld equal to Block Ack and the Direction field equal to either downlink or bidirectional, then it shall initiate a Block Ack negotiation by sending an ADDBA Request frame to the STA that originated the ADDTS Request frame. If a non-DMG STA is granted medium time for an ADDTS Request frame with the Ack Policy subﬁeld equal to Block Ack and the Direction ﬁeld equal to other than downlink, then it shall initiate a Block Ack negotiation by sending an ADDBA Request frame to the recipient of the TS.
  In a non-DMG BSS tIhe combination of the TSID and Direction subﬁelds identiﬁes the TS, in the context of the STA, to which the TSPEC applies. A bidirectional link request is equivalent to a downlink TS and an uplink TS, each with the same TSID and parameters. In a DMG BSS the combination ofthe TSID source DMG STA AID destination DMG STA AID and Direction subﬁel s identiﬁes the TS in the context ofthe   non-AP STA to which the TSPEC applies.
           The same TSID may be used for multiple TSs at different STAs. A STA can use the same TSID subﬁeld value for a downlink TSPEC and either an uplink or a direct-link TSPEC at the same time. In a non-DMG BSS aA non-AP STA shall not use the same TSID for both uplink and direct-link TS. In a DMG BSS a non-AP STA as a source DMG STA can use the TSID subﬁeld value for an uplink PTP TSPEC and at the same time the non-AP STA as a destination DMG STA can use the same TSID subﬁeld value for a downlink PTP TSPEC.
           If the TS Info Ack Policy subﬁeld ofa TSPEC element is Block Ack and the type of Block Ack policy is unknown to the IIC, the IIC assumes, for TXOP scheduling, that the immediate Block Ack policy is being used [sec 9.21).
  An IIC shall be capable of receiving an ADDTS request frame that contains a TCLAS element and capable ofgenerating an indication that contains this as a parameter.
  When a STA requests service at a higher priority than authorized by its dotl lInterworkingTableEntry, the IIC may optionally provide a suggested TSPEC with a data rate and lower priority that would be authorized.
  Usage ofthe TSPEC in an Interworking environment is described in Annex N.
  A STA may include a U-PID element in ADDTS Request and ADDTS Response frames transmitted b the STA. The U-PID element is used to indicate the protocol responsible for handlin MSDUs corresponding to the TID indicated within the frame carrying the U-PID element. Ifa U-PID element is not included in an ADDTS Request frame MSDUs correspondin to the TID contain an LLC protocol header that is used for upper la er protocol selection. A U-PID element shall not be included in an ADDTS Response frame ifa U- PID element was not included in the corresponding ADDTS Request frame. If a U-PID element was included in an ADDTS Request frame the value of the LLC header copy ﬁeld within a U-PID element included in the ADDTS Response frame that has a Status Code of success and is transmitted in response to the received ADDTS Request frame shall be the same as the LLC header copy ﬁeld contained in the ADDTS Request frame. The STA shall set the Status Code ﬁeld to REJECT U-PID SETTING in the

   There are two possible types of failed TS setup:
  a) The transmission of ADDTS Request frame failed.
  b) No ADDTS Response frame is received from the IIC/non-AP STA [e.g., because of delay due to congestion or because the response frame cannot be transmitted).
  Figure 10-9 summarizes the remaining two cases. The MLME shall issue an MLME-ADDTSconfm‘n primitive, with a result code of TIMEOUT. In either case and for a non-DMG BSS, ifthe request is not for an existing TS, the MLME shall send a DELTS to the IIC specifying the TSID and direction of the failed request just in case the IIC had received the request and it was the response that was lost. In both cases and for a DMG BSS ifthe request is not for an existing allocation or TS the MLME shall send a DELTS to the non-AP STA specifvin the Allocation ID or TSID and destination DMG STA ofthe failed request iust in case the PCP/AP had received the request and it was the response that was lost.

 10.4.8 Data Transfer Change theﬂrxt paragraph in 10.4.8 as indicated below:
  After the setup ofa TSPEC or FTP TSPEC, MSDUs are classified above the MAC and are sent to the MAC through the MACiSAP using the MA-UNITDATA.request primitive with the priority parameter encoded to the TSID.
   Insert thefallnwing purugraphx after theﬁn't paragraph 0f10.4.8:
  In a DMG BSS, MSDUs are transmitted using QoS data frames. During each CBAP allocation, the MAC delivers MSDUs based on the priority of the transmitted QoS data frames. The MAC can transmit all MSDUs having a TSID with an associated TSPEC with an access policy of EDCA or SEMM, provided that the source AID ofthe CBAP allocation is equal to the source AID of the TS, or the source AID ofthe CBAP allocation is equal to broadcast AID, or the destination AID of the CBAP matches the destination AID of the TS.
  NOTEiMSDUS having a TSID with no associated TSI’EC are not transmitted, During each SP allocation, the MAC delivers MSDUs whose TSIDs identify TSPECs that have been set up to use the SP allocation. Relative prioritization of multiple TSPECs mapped to the same SP allocation is   implementation dependent and outside the scope of this standard.
  When an MSDU arrives from the MACiSAP with a TSID for which there is no associated TSPEC, the MSDUs shall be sent using EDCA with the access category ACiBE.

lEEE  10.4.9 TS Deletion Change 10.4.9 ax indicated belaw:
  There are two types of TS deletion: non-PCP/non-AP STA-initiated and IIC/PCP-initiated. In both cases, the SME entity above the MAC generates an MLME-DELTS.request primitive specifying either the TS or the allocation  to be deleted and the reason for deleting the TS or allocation respectively. This causes the MAC to send a DELTS Action frame.
        In a PBSS and DMG infrastructure BSS an SP or CBAP allocation can be deleted at any point in time. A PCP/AP can delete an allocation A non-PCP/non-AP STA can delete onl allocations for which either the Source AID or Destination AID of the allocation is equal to the STA’s AID. Deleting an allocation also deletes an TS that is dependent on that allocation as follows:
              : Deletimz an SP allocation shall also delete an TS with access policy SPCA or SEMM usin the allocation.
  7 Deleting a CBAP allocation with Source AID different from the broadcast AID shall also delete an TS with access policy EDCA u ng the allocation.
  7 Deletimz a CBAP allocation with Source AID equal to the broadcast AID shall also delete an TS with access nolic EDCA using the allocation unless there is another CBAP allocation the TS could LC-  A DMG STA that receives an MLME-DELTSrequest primitive for an allocation causes the MAC to send a DELTS Action frame to the PCP/AP. If‘tlie Destination AID of‘the allocation is different from the broadcast AID the PCP/AP shall send a DELTS Action frame to the STA identiﬁed by the Destination AID of the allocation. The PCP/AP shall also delete the SCIICdHlIII infomiation correspondin to the allocation and contained in the Extended Schedule element.
  A DMG STA that receives an MLME-DELTSIreeuest nrimitive for a TS causes the MAC to send a DELTS A n frame to the peer STA e TS.
   The encoding of ReasonCode values to Reason Code field (see 8.4.1.7) values is defined in Table 8-36.
  The TS or allocation is considered inactive within the initiating MAC when the ACK frame to the Action frame is received. No Action frame response is generated.
  Figure 10-10 shows the case of TS deletion initiated by the non-PCP/non-AP STA and the case of TS deletion initiated by the IIC/PCP.
   In Figure [0-10, replaee “HC” by “HC 01 rum-AP STA " (in ﬁve places).
  An IIC should not delete a TSPEC without a request from the SME except due to inactivity (see 10.4.10) or an IIC service change that precludes the IIC from continuing to meet the requirements of the TSPEC.
   All TSPECs or DMG TSPECs that have been set up shall be deleted upon disassociation and reassociation.
 Reassociation ses the non-PCP/non-AP STA and PCP/AP to clear their state, and the non-PCP/non-AP STA has to rei ate the setup.
      10.4.10 TS Timeout Change 10.4.10 as indicated below:
  TS timeout is detected within the IIC/’non-AP STA’s MAC when no traffic is detected on the TS within the inactivity timeout specified when the TS was created.
      

page 401
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  For an uplink TS in a non-DMG BSS or for a TS that has the PCP/AP as the destination DMG STA in a DMG BSS, the timeout is based on the arrival of correctly received MSDUs that belong to the TS after any decryption and reassembly.
     For a downlink TS in a non-DMG BSS or for a TS that has the PCP/AP as the source DMG STA in a DMG BSS, the timeout is based on the following:
 7 Arrival of valid MA-UNITDATArequest primitives using this TS at the MACiSAP when the 005 data frames are sent with the Ack Policy subfield set to No Ack.
  7 Continuation of correctly sent MSDUs that belong to the TS within the MAC when the QoS data frames are sent with the Ack Policy subﬁeld set other than to No Ack.
     In a DMG BSS and in the case ofa TS that is established between non-AP STAs (PTP TSPEC) the timeout ofthe recipient is based on the arrival ofcorrectlv received MSDUs that belong to the TS within the MAC   after any decryption A-MSDU unpacking and reassembly.
        For a TS established between non-AP STAs (PTP TSPEC) the timeout of the originator is based on the follow g : Arrival of valid MA-UNITDATA.request nrimitives using this TS at the MACiSAP when the QoS data frames are sent with the Ack Policv subfield set to No Ack.
  : Confirmation of correctly sent MSDUs that belong to the TS within the MAC when the QoS data frames are sent with the Ack Polic subﬁeld set other than to No Ack.
                 For a direct-link TS in a non-DMG BSS, inactivity is considered to have happened if one of the two following events occurs:
 7 The IIC transmits a QoS CF-Poll frame and the polled STA returns a QoS Null immediately after a SIFS interval that contains a QoS Control ﬁeld in which the Queue Size subﬁeld contains 0.
 7 The IIC transmits a QoS CF-Poll frame, and no QoS Null frame is received within the granted TXOP duration that indicates the queue size for related TSID. This is to ensure that the STA is actually using the assigned TXOP for the given TSID.
  In a non-DMG BSS Aany other use ofa polled TXOP delivered to the STA is considered to be activity on all direct-link TSs associated with that STA. Detection of inactivity ofthis type is optional.
     In response to an inactivity timeout, the IIC shall send a DELTS frame to the STA with the result code set to TIMEOUT and inform its SME using the MLME-DELTSindication primitive. In response to an inactivity timeout the AP DMG STA shall send a DELTS frame to the non-AP DMG STA with the result code set to TIMEOUT and inform its SME usin the MLME-DELTSindication nrimitive. In response to an inactivit timeout the PCP DMG STA shall send a DELTS frame to the non-PCP DMG STA with the result code set to TIMEOUT and infonn its SME usimz the MLME-DELTS.indication nrimitive.
              In a DMG BSS when a TS is established between non-AP STAs (PTP TSPEC) then in resnonse to a TS timeout detected within the ori inator non-AP STA the non-AP STA shall send a DELTS frame to the recinient non-AP STA with the result code set to TIMEOUT and inform its SME usin the MLME- DELTSindication primitive. If the TS timeout is detected within the recipient non-AP STA the STA shall send a DELTS frame to the originator non-AP STA with the result code set to TIMEOUT and infonn its   SME using the MLME-DELTS.i dication primitive.
                 The case of uplink TS timeout in which the PCP/AP is the destination DMG STA of the TS is shown in Figure 10-11.

10.4.13 DMG allocation formats  10.4.13.1 General  A DMG STA manages allocations and TSs as described in 10.4.1 to 10.4.14. Using the DMG TSPEC, a DMG STA can indicate two types of allocation scheduling: isochronous and asynchronous. It should establish an isochronous allocation if it needs periodic access to the channel and does not expect to change the amount oftime allocated frequently. It should establish an asynchronous allocation ifit expects to make requests for channel time and wishes to reserve a minimum amount of channel time to satisfy for these requests when they occur.
  10.4.13.2 Isochronous allocations  In order to request the setup of an isochronous allocation, a DMG STA shall set the Allocation Fomiat ﬁeld in the DMG TSPEC element to 1.
  Following the successful admittance ofa DMG TSPEC with an isochronous allocation, the PCP/AP should allocate time in the beacon interval to meet the periodicity and minimum allocation requirements speciﬁed in the DMG TSPEC element.
  Referring to ﬁelds in the DMG TSPEC element, the PCP/AP should check that over each Allocation Period the sum of the time allocations is at least the Minimum Allocation. In addition, the PCP/AP should check that each individual allocation has a minimum duration of at least Minimum SP Duration. See 8.4.2.136, 9.33.6, and 9.33.6.4.
  With an isochronous DMG TSPEC, the allocation period deﬁnes the period over which the channel time allocation repeats. The scheduler should check that at least the minimum allocation is made within each allocation period. The allocation may be composed ofmultiple SPs. The scheduler also checks that each SP making up the allocation is no shorter than the minimum SP duration. The scheduler is free to position the 51’s that make up the allocation anywhere in the allocation period. The scheduler may allocate up to the maximum allocation each allocation period if resources pemiit.
  10.4.13.3 Asynchronous allocations A DMG STA uses the SPR frame to request channel time for asynchronous trafﬁc.
  For each TID, source DMG STA, and destination DMG STA tuple, the PCP/AP can maintain the amount of outstanding channel time that needs to be allocated. Each time it receives an SPR frame, the amount of outstanding channel time is set to the value received in the SPR frame from the source DMG STA for the identiﬁed TID and destination DMG STA. The amount of outstanding channel time is decreased by the amount allocated when channel time is schedule for that TID, source DMG STA, and destination DMG STA tuple.
  A DMG STA may also use a DMG TSPEC to reserve resources for asynchronous trafﬁc. In this case, the STA shall set the Allocation Fonnat ﬁeld in the DMG TSPEC element to 0. The PCP/AP should admit an asynchronous DMG TSPEC only if it is able to meet the minimum allocation requirements speciﬁed in the DMG TSPEC element.
  With an asynchronous DMG TSPEC, the DMG STA registers the minimum allocation it expects within the allocation period while an SP request is in effect that is greater than the minimum allocation speciﬁed. In  372 Copyrlght © 2012 |EEE.AIl nghts reserved,

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  addition, the STA expects that each allocation is at least Minimum Duration microseconds in duration provided the outstanding SP request is at least that much. In admitting a DMG TSPEC, the PCP/AP should check that there are sufﬁcient resources available to meet the TSPEC requirements.
  10.4.14 PTP TS Operation  The ADDTS Request frame containing the PTP TSPEC may be sent to the peer non-AP DMG STA directly or through PCP/AP DMG STA.
  A non-AP DMG STA may add TSs to an existing allocation. To do this, the non-AP DMG STA transmits an ADDTS Request frame to peer non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA to include the additional TS. The ADDTS Request frame shall contain a PTP TSPEC with the Allocation ID ﬁeld set to indicate the desired allocation to carry the additional TS. A TS with EDCA access policy does not need to be added to any CBAP allocation and can use any CBAP allocation as long as the source AID ofthe CBAP allocation matches the source AID of the TS, or the source AID of the CBAP allocation is equal to the broadcast AID, or the destination AID ofthe CBAP matches the destination AID ofthe TS.
  A non-AP DMG STA transmits an ADDTS Request frame to a peer non-AP DMG STA to add a TS to an existing allocation and to possibly communicate trafﬁc-speciﬁc parameters such as A-MSDU subframe and Maximum MSDU Size with the peer non-AP DMG STA. The non-AP DMG STA may transmit the ADDTS Request frame directly to the peer DMG STA or to the PCP/AP. In the latter case, the ADDTS Request frame shall contain a TCLAS element with the classiﬁer type set to Ethernet parameters; the Source Address ﬁeld shall contain the address ofthe DMG STA that sends the ADDTS Request frame; and the Destination Address ﬁeld shall contain the address ofthe peer DMG STA, which is used by PCP/AP to forward to the peer DMG STA.
  The AP DMG STA or PCP DMG STA shall forward the received ADDTS Request frame to the DMG STA with Address equal to the Destination Address ﬁeld of the Classiﬁer. If an ADDTS Response frame is received by the AP DMG STA or PCP DMG STA in response to the forwarded ADDTS Request frame, then the AP DMG STA or PCP DMG STA shall forward the ADDTS Response frame to the DMG STA with Address equal to the Source Address ﬁeld of the Classiﬁer. The AP DMG STA and the PCP DMG STA shall not change the content of the elements included in the ADDTS Request and ADDTS Response frames.
  Ifthe DMG STA asserts the direction ﬁeld to a value equal to Downlink in the PTP TSPEC included in the ADDTS Request frame, the parameters apply to the DMG STA as the receiving station. For example, in this case, the Maximum MSDU Size ﬁeld indicates that the DMG STA is not able to receive MSDUs longer than the value presented in the MSDU Size ﬁeld. Similarly, ifthe direction ﬁeld indicates uplink, the DMG STA that issued the ADDTS Request frame does not send MSDUs longer than the value ofthe Maximum MSDU Size ﬁeld.

 The DMG STA can use the A-BFT to perform BF ifthe other DMG STA is its PCP/AP. A PCP/AP DMG STA can perform BF with a non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA during a CBAP or by scheduling an SP between the PCP/AP DMG STA and the non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA through an Extended Schedule element transmitted in a DMG Beacon or Announce frame.
  Ifthe link quality between a PCP/AP DMG STA and a non-PCP/non-AP DMG STA degrades, but the DMG STA can still receive DMG Beacon frames with the Next A-BFT field equal to 0, the DMG STA should improve the link quality by performing RSS during the A-BFT period as described in 9.35.5.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  1028.2 PCP Handover 10.28.11 General  A STA is PCP handover capable if the PCP Handover ﬁeld within the STA’s DMG Capabilities element (8.4.2.130) is l. The STA is PCP handover incapable otherwise.
  The PCP handover process allows the information pertinent to the operation ofthe PBSS to be distributed to suitable PCP handover capable STA(s) and for a PCP handover capable STA to take over the PCP responsibilities from the PCP explicitly or implicitly.
  The infomiation peninent to the operation of a PBSS includes STA infomiation and pseudo-static scheduling information.
  The STA information is comprised of the STA’s AID, MAC address and DMG Capabilities element. The PCP may relay the information to all STAs in the PBSS by using the Information Response frame.
  The pseudo-static scheduling infomiation comprises pseudo-static SP and CBAP allocations carried in the Extended Schedule element (8.4.2.134).
  A PCP handover capable STA supports two types ofPCP Handover, explicit and implicit. In Explicit PCP Handover, the PCP explicitly selects and schedules the transfer of PCP responsibilities to another PCP handover capable STA as described in 10.28.21. In Implicit PCP Handover the PCP distributes the Next PCP List element (8.4.2.142) in its DMG Beacon or Announce frames and maintains the content of the NextPCP List element to facilitate the implicit handover process described in 10.28.23. The PCP may decide the priority of Next PCPs and update the Next PCP List based on information contained within a STA’s DMG Capabilities element.
  If there is at least one PCP handover capable STA in the PBSS, the NextPCP List element contains an ordered list of one or more PCP handover capable STAs that can take over the role of the PCP during implicit handover. The ordering of STAs in the NextPCP List is speciﬁed in decreasing priority order and the criteria for updating the NextPCP List are implementation speciﬁc. The PCP shall increment the Token ﬁeld of the NextPCP List by 1 every time the list is changed. Ifthere are no PCP handover capable STAs in the PBSS, the length of the NextPCP List element is 0, and Implicit PCP Handover cannot be performed.
  When a PCP handover capable STA takes over the PCP responsibilities of a PBSS, the pseudo-static scheduling infomiation shall remain unchanged. Any outstanding request for resource allocation is lost and STAs that have outstanding requests for allocation may re-request the resource allocation.
  In explicit PCP handover, the PCP shall use the value of the PCP Factor when selecting the candidate PCP (see 10.1.4.3.4).
  Following a PCP handover, non-PCP STAs shall attempt to transmit a frame to the new PCP within dotllMaxLostBeacons beacon intervals. If the new PCP does not receive at least one frame from an associated non-PCP STA for dot11MaxLostBeacons beacon intervals following a PCP handover, it should disassociate the STA from the PBSS.
  10.28.22 Explicit Handover procedure  The PCP may transmit a Handover Request frame to a non-PCP STA that is handover capable. Upon receiving a Handover Request, a non-PCP STA becomes the candidate PCP. If the Handover Request is accepted, the candidate PCP shall transmit a Handover Response frame to the PCP with the Handover Result ﬁeld set to 0. If the Handover Request is rejected, the candidate PCP shall transmit a Handover Response frame to the PCP with the Handover Result ﬁeld set to l, 2, or 3 and cease to be the candidate PCP.

lEEE  A non-PCP STA that is handover capable may transmit a Handover Request frame to the PCP ofthe PBSS if the PCP is handover capable. Upon transmission of the Handover Request frame, the non-PCP STA becomes the candidate PCP. If the Handover Request is accepted, the PCP shall transmit a Handover Response frame to the candidate PCP with the Handover Result ﬁeld set to 0. If the Handover Request is rejected, the PCP shall transmit a Handover Response frame to the candidate PCP with the Handover Result ﬁeld set to l, 2, or 3, and the candidate PCP shall cease to be a candidate PCP.
     Following the transmi ion or reception ofa successful Handover Response frame, a candidate PCP should request STA information and pseudo-static scheduling information from the PCP using an Information Request frame within the next dotl lerOfChangeBeacons beacon intervals. The candidate PCP should also request SPs to perform beamfomiing and, if appropriate, establish a security association with other associated STAs prior to the completion of PCP handover.
  Following the successful reception or transmission ofa Handover Response frame, the PCP shall transmit a PCP Handover element within every DMG Beacon or Announce frame for each of the next dotl lerOfChangeBeacons beacon intervals with the Old BSSID ﬁeld set to the BSSID ofthe PBSS, the New PCP Address ﬁeld set to the MAC address ofthe candidate PCP, and the Remaining Bls ﬁeld set to the number ofbeacon intervals remaining until the candidate PCP takes over the role of PCP for the PBSS. The initial value ofthe Remaining Bls ﬁeld shall be equal to the Remaining BI ﬁeld value last transmitted by the PCP in a Handover Request frame to the candidate PCP or equal to the Remaining BI ﬁeld value last received by the PCP in a Handover Request frame from the candidate PCP, whichever is later. A non-PCP STA receiving a DMG Beacon or Announce frame containing the PCP Ilandover element shall set the STA’s local countdown counter to the value of the Remaining Bls ﬁeld contained in the PCP Ilandover element. The STAs shall then decrease the local countdown counter by one at each TBTT, and shall use the candidate PCP’s address contained in the New PCP Address ﬁeld within the PCP Handover element as the new beacon ﬁlter address once the STA’s local countdown reaches zero. When the countdown timer equals zero, the candidate PCP shall assume the role of PCP.
  10.28.23 Implicit Handover procedure  Upon receiving the NextPCP List element, a PCP handover capable STA that ﬁnds its AID as the AID entry 2' in the NextPCP List element received from the PCP becomes the Implicit candidate PCP 2'. Upon detecting a Token value contained in the NextPCP List element that is different from the value of the last Token received from the PCP, each Implicit candidate PCP should request STA information and pseudo-static scheduling information from the PCP by transmitting an Information Request frame addressed to the PCP (1029.1).
  The implicit handover process is triggered at the Implicit candidate PCP i when the Implicit candidate PCP 1' fails to receive a DMG Beacon or Announce frames from the PCP for (i X dotl lImplicitlIandoverLostBeacons) beacon intervals. When triggered, the Implicit candidate PCP i shall send at least one DMG Beacon frame during each of the next dotl lMaxLostBeacons BTIs if the following conditions are met:
   7 No DMG Beacon or Announce frames are received from the PCP.
7 No DMG Beacon frame carrying a PCP Handover element with the value of the Old BSSID ﬁeld  equal to the BSSID ofthe PBSS is received from an Implicit candidate PCP with a smaller index on the NextPCP List.
  Each DMG Beacon sent by the Implicit candidate PCP i shall contain a PCP Handover element with the Old BSSID ﬁeld set to the BSSID ofthe PBSS from which control is being taken, i.e., the previous PBSS, the New PCP Address ﬁeld set to its MAC address, and the Remaining BIs ﬁeld initially set to dotl lMaxLostBeacons and decremented by l at each TBTT. A member non-PCP STA of the PBSS, after failing to receive a DMG Beacon or Announce frame for dotl lMaxLostBeacons beacon intervals, should associate with the new PCP sending a DMG Beacon frame containing the PCP Handover element with Old

The Implicit candidate PCP that successfully transmits a DMG Beacon with the Remaining BIs ﬁeld within the PCP Handover element equal to zero completes the implicit handover by scheduling, if appropriate, pseudo- static SPs between its member STAs following the pseudo-static scheduling information it obtained from the previous PBSS.
  To avoid disruptions to pseudo-static SPs due to implicit handover, the value of dotl1ImplicitlIandoverLostBeacons should be lower than the value of dotl lMaxLostBeacons.
  10.29 DMG BSS peer and service discovery 1029.1 Information Request and Response  A STA may request information about either a single STA in the PBSS or about all ofthe STAs in the PBSS by sending an Infomiation Request frame (8.5.20.4). If the STA is requesting information about only a single STA in the PBSS, it shall set the Subject Address ﬁeld in the Information Request frame to the MAC address ofthat STA. Ifthe STA is requesting infomiation about all oftlie STAs in the PBSS, it shall set the Subject Address ﬁeld in the Information Request frame to the broadcast address and shall transmit the Information Request frame to the PCP.
  A STA may transmit an Information Request frame with the length ﬁeld of the Request element set to 0 to another STA in the PBSS to detemiine ifthe destination DMG STA is still present in the PBSS and is within range ofthe sending STA.
  A STA may transmit an Information Request frame including its STA Capability element and other elements. A non-PCP STA shall not include in the Infomiation Request frame the capability information corresponding to another STA.
  The STA may transmit an Information Response frame (8.5.20.5) either unsolicited or as a response to an Information Request frame. Ifa STA is providing information about a single STA in the PBSS, it shall set the Subject Address ﬁeld in the Information Response frame to the MAC address of that STA. Ifa STA is providing information about all of the STAs in the PBSS, it shall set the Subject Address ﬁeld in the Information Response frame to the broadcast address.
   A STA shall include in the Information Response frame the elements requested by the originator STA.
  A STA shall send an Infomiation Response frame with an empty payload in response to a received Information Request frame that solicits information about a single target STA if  7 The target STA is not a member of the PBSS and the STA sending the Information Response frame is the PCP oftlie PBSS, or   7 The target STA is not the STA sending the Information Response frame.
  In all other cases, the STA shall send the Information Response frame with the infomiation requested by the requesting STA.
  1029.2 Peer Service Discovery A PCP/AP may provide different types of infomiation to a non-PCP/non-AP STA upon request. To query available services in a BSS, a non-PCP/non-AP STA shall send either an Information Request frame or a  Probe Request frame to the PCP/AP (1029.1). The Information Request and Information Response frames are robust management frames, while the Probe Request and Probe Response frames are not.
      

page 418
lEEE  Upon receiving the Information Request frame, the PCP/AP shall respond with an Information Response only ifall ofthe following three criteria are true:
  a) The SSID in the Infomiation Request is the wildcard SSID or the speciﬁc SSID ofthe PCP/AP.
  b) The BSSID ﬁeld in the Information Request is the wildcard BSSID or the BSSID ofthe PCP/AP.
  c) The DA ﬁeld in the Information Request is the MAC address ofthe PCP/AP.
  The PCP/AP transmits the Infomiation Response frame to the address of the non-PCP/non-AP STA that generated the Infomiation Request.
   The Information Response frame may include vendor-speciﬁc elements.
  10.30 Changing DMG BSS parameters 1030.1 General   This subclause describes the methods used by the PCP/AP to change certain key characteristics ofthe BSS.
 It also describes a method for a non-PCP/non-AP STA to make a recommendation on those characteristics to the PCP/AP.
  The PCP/AP delivers the DMG BSS Parameter Change element to STAs holding pseudo-static SPs and STAs in power save mode before a DMG BSS parameter change.
  The PCP/AP shall initiate a DMG BSS parameter change by including a DMG BSS Parameter Change element (8.4.2.129) in its DMG Beacon or Announce frames. The PCP/AP places the DMG BSS Parameter Change element in every DMG Beacon or Announce frame after the DMG BSS Parameter Change element is ﬁrst included in the frame, stopping in the DMG Beacon or Announce frame immediately after the DMG BSS parameter change takes effect.
  1030.2 Moving the TBTT  The PCP/AP may move the TBTT and hence move the entire beacon interval. Moving the beacon interval means that except for the beacon interval in which the change takes effect, the beacon interval duration is unchanged while the position ofthe TBTT is moved.
  The TBTT shall not be moved by an amount that is larger than the value in the Beacon Interval ﬁeld present in DMG Beacon and Announce frames in which the DMG BSS Parameter Change element is sent.
  To move the TBTT to an intended new TBTT, the PCP/AP shall insert the DMG BSS Parameter Change element in DMG Beacon frames and/or Announce frames with the Move ﬁeld set to 1 (8.4.2.129). The DMG Beacon frames and/or the Announce frames containing the DMG BSS Parameter Change element shall be sent at each TBTT dotl lerOfChangeBeacons times before the TBTT is changed as indicated in the TBTT offset ﬁeld.
  At each transmission of the DMG BSS Parameter Change element, the TBTT Offset ﬁeld shall be set to a value equal to the lower order 4 octets ofthe intended new TBTT.
   The value ofdotl lerOfChangeBeacons shall be greater than dotl lMaxLostBeacons.
  NOTEiAs deﬁned in 10.1.2.1, the PCP transmits at least one DMG Beacon frame to each associated STA within a time interval that is not longer than dotl lBeaeonI’ericd >< dotl l MaxLostBeacons TUs.
  Announce frames shall be used to deliver the DMG BSS Parameter Change element to all STAs participating in pseudo-static SPs.

  If a PCP/AP is required to change the beacon interval or/and TBTT to participate in a PCP/AP cluster or to change the beacon interval or/and TBTT as a result of its S-PCP/S-AP’s parameters change (sec 9.34), it shall follow the procedures in 10.301 and 10.30.}.
  10.30.5 Recommending DMG 355 parameters to the PCP/AP  A non-PCP/non-AP STA may make a recommendation for DMG BSS parameters to the PCP/AP by including a DMG BSS Parameter Change element in an Information Request or Infomiation Response   frame sent to the PCP/AP.

The non- PCP/non-AP should select a value for the TBTT Offset field that gives the PCP/AP enough time to exercise the change. Similarly, a non-PCP/non-AP STA may recommend a beacon interval duration to the PCP/AP by setting the Size subfield in the Change Type Bitmap ﬁeld ofthe DMG BSS Parameter Change element to 1 and setting the BI Duration ﬁeld to the recommended beacon interval duration in TUs.
  A PCP/AP that receives an Information Request or an unsolicited Infomiation Response frame from a non- PCP/non-AP STA containing a DMG BSS Parameter Change element may use the information within the element to change the DMG BSS parameters. When receiving an Infomiation Request frame that includes the DMG BSS Parameter Change element, PCP/AP responds with an Infomation Response frame as speciﬁed in 10.29.]. If the PCP/AP changes the BSS parameters in the transmitted Infomiation Response frame, the PCP/AP shall include a DMG BSS Parameter Change element reﬂecting the BSS parameter changes and shall use the procedure deﬁned in 10.302 and 10.30.}, as appropriate, to change the BSS parameters. If the PCP/AP decides not to change the BSS parameters, it shall not include a DMG BSS Parameter Change element in the transmitted Information Response frame.
  10.31 Spatial sharing and interference mitigation for DMG STAs 1031.1 General  This subclause describes mechanisms to enable spatial sharing and interference mitigation within a PBSS/ infrastructure BSS and in a uncoordinated OBSS environment.
  Spatial sharing mechanisms allow SPs belonging to different STAs in the same spatial vicinity to be scheduled concurrently over the same channel, and for interference mitigation. Altematively, the PCP/AP can use CBAPs to mitigate interference.
  The SPSII and Interference Mitigation field in the DMG Capabilities element indicates whether a STA supports spatial sharing.
  A STA that supports spatial sharing, as indicated in the SPSII and Interference Mitigation field equal to l in the STA’s DMG Capabilities element, shall support the directional channel quality measurements described in 8.4.2.2116 and 8.4.2.24.15.
  1031.2 Spatial sharing and interference assessment  The PCP/AP should request STAs to perfomi and report spectmm and radio resource measurements described in 10.1 1 to assess the poss 'lity to perform spatial sharing and for interference mitigation.
     The PCP/AP should use the directional channel quality described in 8.4.2.2116 and 8.4.2.24.15 to assess the possibility for spatial sharing of SPs.
  An SP to be a. sed for spatial sharing with other scheduled (existing) SPs or considered to be reallocated in the beacon interval is hereby termed as a candidate SP. There might be multiple candidate and existing SPs at one time, and an SP may simultaneously assume the role of candidate and existing SP depending upon the context it is used for spatial sharing and interference assessment.
     STAs that participate in an SP and that support spatial sharing should perform beamfomiing training with each other before engaging in any other communication or performing any measurements described in this subclause.
  The PCP/AP should request source DMG STA and destination DMG STA involved in a candidate SP to perform measurements for the purpose of spatial sharing with an existing SP only after the STAs have      

page 422
lEEE  beamforming trained with each other. The PCP/AP can infer that the STAs in a candidate SP have a beamformed link with each other ifthe Beamforming Training ﬁeld within the DMG TSPEC used to set up the candidate SP was set to l and at least one beacon interval has elapsed since the candidate SP was ﬁrst scheduled.
  If the PCP/AP transmits a Directional Channel Quality Request to a STA involved in a candidate SP to assess the possibility for spatial sharing with another existing SP, it shall set the Target STA to the corresponding peer STA’s MAC address involved in the candidate SP and shall set the Measurement Method ﬁeld to indicate ANIPI.
  If the candidate SP has already been allocated channel time, the PCP/AP should additionally transmit a Directional Channel Quality Request to the STAs involved in the existing SP to assess the possibility for spatial sharing with the candidate SP. In the Directional Channel Quality Request, the PCP/AP shall set the Target STA to the corresponding peer STA involved in the existing SP and shall set the Measurement Method ﬁeld to indicate ANIPI.
  NOTEiwhen tlie PCP/AP transmits a directional cliannel quality request to a STA of an existing SP, it intends to assess the channel quality during transmission by STAs belonging to the candidate SP. Similarly, when the PCP/AP transmits a directional channel qualin request to a STA ofa candidate SP, it intends to assess the channel quality during transmission by STAs belonging to the existing SP.
  Ifa recipient STA that receives a Directional Channel Quality Request frame is already beamformed trained with the target STA speciﬁed by the AID ﬁeld within the frame, then the recipient STA shall carry out the measurement employing the same receive antenna conﬁguration as is used by the recipient STA when receiving frames from the target STA. Ifthe AID ﬁeld is set to the broadcast AID or an unknown AID, then the recipient STA shall perform the measurements using a quasi-omni antenna pattem.
  Figure 10-31 illustrates an example of spatial sharing assessment between two SPs. In this example, SP1 is the existing SP and SP2 is the candidate SP. The PCP/AP transmits a Directional Channel Quality Request to STAs C and D to measure over SPl’s channel allocation, and transmits a Directional Channel Quality Request to STAs A and B to measure over SP2’s channel allocation. The relation of the Measurement Start Time and Measurement Duration ﬁelds in the Directional Channel Quality Request message is shown in Figure 10-31, while the ﬁeld Number of Time Blocks is the ratio [Measurement Duration/Measurement Unit).

The report shall be formatted and transmitted as per specified in the Directional Channel Quality Request. The non-PCP/non-AP STA shall set the Report Mode ﬁeld (8.4.2.24) in the report frame to indicate whether it performed the measurement as requested by the PCP/AP.
  10.313 Achieving spatial sharing and interference mitigation  A PCP/AP can estimate the channel quality across STAs participating in the BSS and implement spatial sharing and interference mitigation based on the results of the measurements performed by the STAs associated with the PCP/AP.
  A PCP/AP should schedule a candidate SP that overlaps with an existing SP in its beacon interval only after it receives a Directional Channel Quality Report from the STAs involved in the candidate SP.
  Ifa candidate SP is already scheduled in the beacon interval, the PCP/AP should schedule this candidate SP time-overlapping with an existing SP in its beacon interval only after it receives a Directional Channel Quality Report from the STAs involved in the existing SP.
  The PCP/AP should schedule a candidate SP during a period oftirne in the beacon interval where the PBSS/ infrastructure BSS performance is expected to be maximized. The detemiination of performance maximization should be based on measurement reports received by the PCP/AP, but is implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this standard.
  The decision process at the PCP/AP to perform spatial sharing of a candidate and an existing SP is implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this standard.
  The candidate SP is referred to as a Time-Overlapped SP following the allocation by the PCP/AP of a candidate SP overlapping in time with an existing SP.
  Figure 10-32 illustrates an example oftlie resulting SP schedule in the beacon interval for the spatial sharing between the two SPs shown in Figure 10-31.

In the Directional Channel Quality Request that the PCP/AP transmits to each STA, the PCP/AP shall set the Target STA to the peer STA involved in the same SP and shall set the Measurement Method field to indicate RSNI.
  If a spatial sharing capable non-PCP/non-AP STA receives a Directional Channel Quality Request from its PCP/AP, it should perform the measurements as indicated in the request and shall report the results back to the PCP/AP using the Directional Channel Quality Report. The report shall be formatted and transmitted as per speciﬁed in the corresponding Directional Channel Quality Request.
      

page 424
lEEE  The PCP/AP should stop the spatial sharing oftwo or more SPs ifit detemlines that the link quality ofany of the links involved in the spatial sharing has dropped below acceptable levels. This detennination should be based on Directional Channel Quality Reports received by the PCP/AP, bllt is implementation dependent and beyond the scope ofthis standard.
  The STA may include the TSCONST ﬁeld with the ADDTS Request sent to the PCP/AP for the purpose of interference mitigation. The PCP/AP should consider the information in the TSCONST ﬁeld speciﬁed by a STA in its SP schedule.
  Speciﬁc algorithms to realize spatial sharing and interference mitigation among SPs between different STAs is implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this standard.
  1031.4 PBSS and infrastructure BSS stability in OBSS scenarios  Except when performing FST (10.32), the PCP/AP limits the frequency with which it changes the operating PBSS/infrastructure BSS channel to alleviate the instability and ripple effect that might result from frequent channel changes in OBSS scenarios. Upon a channel switch, the PCP/AP ofa PBSS/infrastructure BSS shall select a random number, N, unifonnly distributed between [0, Switchlnterval-1] and shall not attempt a new channel switch until N beacon intervals have elapsed since the preceding channel switch. The initial value of Switchlnterval is aMinSwitchInterval and it is doubled upon every new channel switch up to a maximum value of aMaxSwitchInterval. The PCP/AP resets Switchlnterval to aMinSwitchInterval ifit remains on the same operating channel for a minimum of aMaxSwitchInterval consecutive beacon intervals.
  NOTﬁiThe PCP ’AP cau keep the 51> schedule stable aercss beacon intervals and minimize schedule changes. This is to allow rot STAs to associate with the l’BSS/infrastrueture BSS or add or modify their SP reservations.

A multi-band capable device is said to be a member ofa BSS when one or more ofthe STAs in the device is a member ofthe BSS. A STA that is part ofa multi-band capable device advertises the capability by including the Multi-band element in Beacon, DMG Beacon, (Re)Association Request, (Re)Association Response, Information Request, Infomlation Response, Probe Request, Probe Response, Announce, FST Setup Request, FST Setup Response, TDLS Discovery Request, TDLS Discovery Response, TDLS Setup Request, and TDLS Setup Response frames.
  Except for the PST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frames, which shall not include more than one Multi-band element, a STA may include more than one Multi-band element in any one ofthese frames ifit is part ofa device that supports more than two bands or channels. Ifa PCP/AP includes one or more Multi- band elements within a (Re)Association Response frame with Status Code equal to DENIED7WITIIiSUGGESTEDiBANDiANDiclIANNEL or a Probe Response frame, the order in which these elements appear in the frame indicate the order, in terms of frequency band and channel number, that the device that includes the STA addressed by the frame should attempt join the BSS following the rules applicable to the respective frequency band and channel (see 10.1). For each Multi-band element contained in the frame starting from the ﬁrst one and proceeding in increasing order, the STA should attempt to join the BSS using the BSSID indicated by the BSSID ﬁeld, frequency band indicated by the Band ID ﬁeld and channel number indicated by the Channel Number ﬁeld provided the Beacon Interval and the Channel Number ﬁelds in the Multi-band element are both nonzero.
   NOTEiThe ﬁrsl Multi-band element in the frame can terei to the current operating frequency band and clianuel.
      

page 425
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  A multi-band capable device shall set the Band ID and Operating Class ﬁelds within a Multi-band element to specify a frequency band it supports. Ifthe multi-band capable device is or intends to operate in the band indicated within the Multi-band element, it shall set the Channel Number ﬁeld to indicate the channel of operation within that band. If the multi-band capable device is a member of a BSS both on the channel indicated in the Channel Number ﬁeld within the Multi-band element and also in the channel on which this element is transmitted, then the multi-band capable device shall set the TSF Offset ﬁeld within a Multi-band element to the difference between the TSF ofthe BSS of which the STA is member on the channel indicated in the Channel Number ﬁeld ofthis element and the TSF of the BSS corresponding to the BSSID indicated in the Address 3 ﬁeld ofthe MPDU in which this element is transmitted. In all other cases, the TSF Offset ﬁeld shall be set to 0.
  The FST session transition is managed by FST session setup protocol. A multi-band capable device participates as an initiator or as a responder in the FST session setup. Depending on the STA’s behavior during the FST session setup, the FST session can be operational in one band, or may be transferred to another band or channel in the same band, or can be operational in multiple bands and/or channels simultaneously and in this case MSDUs can be transmitted in different bands and/or channels any time an MSDU arrives at the MAC SAP. If a multi-band capable device is operational in more than one band/ channel simultaneously, the STA may use the FST session setup protocol to change the operation to a single channel.
  An FST session between an initiator and a responder is identiﬁed by an FSTS ID. The value ofthe FSTS ID is allocated by the initiator of an FST session and shall remain unchanged whether the FST session is operational in one band or more than one band simultaneously. The value ofthe FSTS ID shall be unique for an initiator and responder pair, and there shall be no more than one FST session between an initiator and responder pair. If an initiator or responder desires to change the FSTS ID of its existing FST session, it shall tear down the existing FST session (1032.3) and set up a new one with a different FSTS ID value.
  In each band/channel, a multi-band capable device may use the same or different MAC addresses. When the STA MAC Address Present ﬁeld is l in a Multi-band element, the STA MAC Address ﬁeld in the Multi- band element speciﬁes the MAC address that the STA uses in the band and channel that are indicated in the Multi-band element. lfthe STA MAC Address Present ﬁeld is 0, the MAC address that the STA uses in the frequency band and channel that are indicated in the Multi-band element is the same as the address the STA uses in the current operating band and channel.
  The FST session addressing mode is Transparent if both initiator and responder ofthe FST session use the same MAC address in the frequency bands/channels involved in the FST session transfer. The FST session addressing mode is Nontransparent if either the initiator or responder use different MAC addresses in the different frequency bands/channels involved in the FST session. When transparent FST is used, the STA shall present a single MAC-SAP to higher layers for all frequency bands/channels in which it uses that MAC address.
  An FST is allowed ifthe FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frames are permitted to be transmitted as indicated in 10.3.3.
  A multi-band capable device should deliver all fragments, if any, of an MSDU of an FST session before it transfers the FST session.
  A multi-band capable device shall include, in any transmitted FST Setup Request and in any transmitted FST Setup Response, the capabilities element, the operation element, the EDCA Parameter Set element, Supported Rates element, Extended Supported Rates element, and Supported Channels element that are applicable to the band and channel number indicated within its most recently transmitted Multi-band element that was transmitted on the same band and channel number on which it is transmitting the FST Setup Request or FST Setup Response frames.

  If a Session Transition element and a Multi-band element are present in the same frame and the values of the Operating Class and Channel Number ﬁelds within the Multi-band element are both nonzero, the value of the Band ID ﬁeld related to the new band within the Session Transition element shall be the same as the Band ID ﬁeld within the Multi-band element.
  1032.2 FST setup protocol 10.32.11 General  The FST setup protocol comprises four states and rules for how to move from one state to the next. The states are Initial, Setup Completion, Transition Done, and Transition Conﬁrmed. In the Initial state, the FST session is operational in one or both bands/channels. In the Setup Completion state, both initiator and responder are ready to change their currently operating band(s)/channel[s). An FST session can be fully or partially transferred to another band/channel or transferred back to one band/channel. The Transition Done state enables both initiator and responder to operate in the other band/channel ifthe value ofthe LLT was zero. Both initiator and responder have to successfully communicate in the new band/channel to reach the Transition Conﬁrmed state. The state transition diagram ofthe FST setup protocol is shown in Figure 10-34.
  Figure 10-33 depicts the procedure of the FST setup protocol that drives the state machine shown in Figure 10-34. The ﬁgure is only an example ofthe basic procedure and is not meant to be exhaustive of all possible uses of the protocol. In the ﬁgure, MLME 1 and MLME 2 represent any two MLMEs ofa multi- band capable device according to the reference model described in 4.9.4. In addition, the parameter :1 corresponds to the number of FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frame exchanges until both the FST initiator and FST responder successfully move to the Setup Completion state, as described below.
  To establish an FST session in the Initial state and transfer it to the Setup Completion state ofthe FST setup protocol (Figure 10-34), an initiator and responder shall exchange FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frames. An FST session exists in Setup Completion state, Transition Done state, or Transition Conﬁmied state. In the Initial and in the Setup Completion states, the old band/channel represents the frequency band/channel from which the FST session is to be transferred, and the new band/channel represents the frequency band/channel to which the FST session is to be transferred. In the Transition Done state, the new band/channel represents the frequency band/channel from which the FST Ack Request and FST Ack Response frames, if any, are transmitted, and the old band/channel represents the frequency band/ channel from which the FST session is being transferred.
  The responder shall set the Status Code ﬁeld to SUCCESS if it accepts the FST Setup Request, shall set the Status Code to REJECTED7WITIIiSUGGESTEDiCIIANGES (see 8.4.1.9) to indicate that one or more parameters ofthe FST Setup Request are invalid and shall suggest alternative parameters, shall set the Status Code to PENDINGiADMITTINGiFSTisESSION or PENDINGiGAPilNiBAiwlNDOW to indicate that an FST Setup Request is pending, and shall set the Status Code ﬁeld to 37 (“The request has been declined") to reject an FST Setup Request.
  A responder that is also an enabling STA (see 10.12) may set the Status Code to REJECTﬁDSEiBAND to indicate that the FST Setup Request is rejected because it was initiated by a dependent STA (see 10.12) that is requesting transition to a frequency band subject to DSE procedures. In this case, ifthe responder is the enabling STA for the dependent STA, the responder may include a Timeout Interval element in the FST Setup Response frame to indicate the period in TUs before which it initiates an FST Setup with the dependent STA. The Timeout Interval Type ﬁeld within the Timeout Interval element shall be set to 4. The responder can use the parameters in the FST Setup Request frame received from the dependent STA to initiate an FST Setup with the initiator.

     10.32.22 Trans     Ing between states  A state transition within the FST setup protocol is controlled by the State Transition Timer (STT). Each STA maintains a STT for each FST session. The STAs shall move to the Initial state when the STT moves from 1 to 0 (other than set to 0) or upon reception or transmission of an FST Tear Down frame.
  The initiator shall set the STT to the value ofthe FSTSessionTimeOut field at successful transmission of an FST Setup Request frame and at each ACK frame sent in response to a received FST Setup Response with the Status Code ﬁeld equal to PENDINGiADMITTINGiFSTisESSION or PENDINGiGAPilNiBAiwlNDOW.

In the latter case, the responder shall transmit the unsolicited FST Setup Response frame to the initiator.
  There might be multiple FST Setup Request and FST Setup Response frame transmissions by the initiator and the responder, respectively, until the FST session between these STAs becomes established. At each transition, or attempt to transition, from the Initial state to the Setup Completion state, the initiator and responder shall perfomi the following procedure:
   1) The initiator sends an FST Setup Request frame to the responder.
  2) Upon receipt of an FST Setup Request frame, the responder shall respond with an FST Setup Response frame unless it has a pending FST Setup Request frame addressed to the initiator and the responder has a numerically larger MAC address than the initiator’s MAC address, in which case, the responder shall delete the received FST Setup Request.
  3) If, after the reception of the acknowledgment to the initiator’s FST Setup Request frame, the initiator receives an FST Setup Request frame from the responder, the initiator shall not respond with an FST Setup Response frame if its MAC address is numerically larger (see

ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND  lEEE Std 802.11ad-2012     10. 3.4) than the responder’s MAC address. Otherwise, if its MAC address s numerically smaller than the responders MAC address, it becomes the responder and responds with the FST Setup Response frame and shall not send the FST Setup Request frame during the current FST session transition.
                                      4) The initiator shall not move to the Setup Completion state if at least one of the following conditions is met:

  The initiator shall set the STT to the value of the FSTSessionTimeOut ﬁeld at successful transmission of an FST Ack Request frame or at transmission of any individually addressed MPDU to responder. The initiator shall set the STT to zero at the transmission ofan ACK sent in response to a received FST Ack Response from the responder or at reception of an ACK frame received in response to a frame sent to the responder.

 The responder shall transmit an FST Ack Response frame to the initiator no later than FSTSessionTimeOut after the transmission ofan ACK frame sent in response to a received FST Ack Request from the initiator.
  The SME of both the initiator and responder generates an MLME-FSTIncoming.request primitive that includes the parameters of the FST session transfer. This primitive shall be generated to the MLME associated with the channel number, operating class, and band ID speciﬁed in the Multi- band element negotiated during the FST session setup. This primitive notiﬁes the MLME of an impending FST session transfer.
  The initiator shall send an FST Ack Request frame or may send any other individually addressed A- MPDU, MPDU, or MMPDU to the responder.

  Following the successful FST transition to a new band, the STA ofthe FST session shall follow the medium access rules applicable on the new band.
  10.32.23 FST TS switching  If a STA transmitting an FST Setup Request or an FST Setup Response does not intend to switch all its streams, then the STA shall include the Switching Stream element in the transmitted frame to indicate which streams are requested to be transferred to the other band/channel. If the FST Setup Request frame includes a Switching Stream element, the FST Setup Response frame should include a Switching Stream element. If the FST Setup Request frame does not include a Switching Stream element, the FST Setup Response frame may include a Switching Stream element. If the STA transmitting the Switching Stream element has not set up a stream in the band indicated in the New Band ID field within this element, it shall set the Stream ID in New Band Valid field to 0. A STA may set up a stream in any band/channel by transmitting ADDBA Request or ADDTS Request frames that include the Multi-band element.
  If a STA transmits an ADDTS Request frame to another STA with which it has established an FST session and the ADDTS Request frame is transmitted in a band or channel different from the band or channel to which the ADDTS Request is intended to apply, the ADDTS Request frame shall include the Multi-band element with the Band ID, Operating Class, and Channel Number fields set to indicate to which channel the ADDTS Request frame applies. In addition, if these STAs use the nontransparent mode for FST session transfer, the STA transmitting the ADDTS Request frame sets the STA MAC Address Present field to l and the STA MAC Address field to the MAC address that the STA uses in the band and channel number that are indicated in the Multi-band element contained in the ADDTS Request frame. Similar to the ADDTS Request frame, the Multi-band element shall be included in the ADDBA Request, ADDTS Response, ADDBA Response, DELTS, and DELBA frames when these frames are transmitted in a band or channel different from the band or channel to which they are intended to apply.
  When using transparent mode to transfer an FST session corresponding to a TID/TSID, the Direction subfield within the TSPEC element, if any, used to set up the TID/TSID should not be set to indicate a bidirectional link. This enables the SME to use the TID/TSID in conjunction with the source and destination MAC addresses in both the old and new frequency band/channel to uniquely identify the FST session.
  If any oftlie ADDTS variants is used to switch the TS, the FTP TSPEC or the DMG TSPEC shall be used when the TS is being established to operate in a DMG BSS, and the Basic TSPEC shall be used when the TS is being established to operate in a non-DMG BSS irrespective of the band and channel used to communicate the ADDTS frames and the DMG ADDTS frames.

lEEE   The rules deﬁned below apply when the ADDTS frames or the DMG ADDTS frames are used to switch TS.
 When the ADDTS frames and the DMG ADDTS frames are used, then the ADDTS requester and the ADDTS responder provide the functions deﬁned for the ADDBA Originator and the ADDBA Recipient, respectively.
  If the ADDBA Recipient includes the Switching Stream element in any of the FST Setup Request or FST Setup Response frames and ifthe Stream ID in New Band Valid ﬁeld within the Switching Stream element is 0, the ADDBA Originator should issue the DELBA frame to reject the BA agreements indicated in the Stream ID in Old Band ﬁeld. lfthe Originator intends to establish new BA agreements in the band indicated in the Multi-band element sent by the Recipient and with the Rec ient MAC address indicated in the Multi- band element sent by the Recipient, the Originator shall transmit an ADDBA Request frame addressed to the Recipient.
     The Originator may include the Multi-band element and the Ethernet type TCLAS element in the ADDBA request frame. If the MAC Addresses of the Originator and Recipient to be used in the new band are different from the MAC addresses used in the old hand, then the ADDBA frame sent in the old band to establish a Block Ack in the new band shall include the Multi-band and the TCLAS elements. The resulting BA agreement, ifestablished, applies to the band and channel identiﬁed in the Multi-band element included in the ADBBA frame. The BA is identiﬁed by the TID/T SID and MAC addresses of the Originator and the Recipient used in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element included in the ADDBA frames.
  The ADDBA Request frame may be issued in the old band and channel, and the corresponding ADDBA Response frame may be transmitted in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element within the ADDBA Request frame.
   The following rules for the multi-band BA establishment shall apply:
  1) lfthe TA and/or the RA ﬁelds ofthe ADDBA Request frame are different from the Originator MAC address and/or the Recipient MAC address, respectively, used in the channel and band where the BA agreement should operate, then the Originator shall set the Source Address ﬁeld and the Destination Address ﬁeld of the classiﬁer to the Originator MAC Address and the Recipient MAC address, respectively, to be used in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element included in the ADDBA Request frame.
  2) If the TA and RA are equal to the Originator MAC address and the Recipient MAC address, respectively, then the Multi-band element, if any, included in the ADDBA Request frame shall indicate the band and channel over which the established BA is operating. The TCLAS element shall not be included in this ADDBA Request frame.
  3) The Multi-band element should not be included in the ADDBA Request frame ifin the case [2) the ADDBA Request frame is issued in the same band and channel over which the BA shall operate.
  4) If the TA and/or the RA ﬁelds of the ADDBA Response frame are different from the Recipient MAC address and/or the Originator MAC address, respectively, to be used in the channel and band where the BA agreement should operate, then the Recipient shall set the Source Address ﬁeld and the Destination Address ﬁeld of the classiﬁer to the Recipient MAC Address and the Originator MAC address, respectively, to be used in the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element included in the ADDBA Response frame. The indicated band and channel shall be equal to the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element of the ADDBA Request frame.
  5) If the TA and RA ﬁelds are equal to the Recipient MAC address and the Originator MAC address, respectively, then the Multi-band element, if any, included in the ADDBA Response frame shall indicate the band and channel over which the established BA is operating. The indicated band and channel shall be equal to the band and channel indicated in the Multi-band element of the ADDBA Request frame. The TCLAS element shall not be included in the ADDBA Response frame.

  10.32.25 FST teardown  At the Setup Completion state or Transition Done state, a STA may transmit an FST Tear Down frame to its peer STA ofthe FST session in order to tear down an FST session that was previously set up using the FST Setup Request/Response frame exchange. Upon transmission or reception of an FST Tear Down frame, the initiator and responder move to the Initial state (10.322). When moving to the Initial state and ifthe value of the Switch intent ﬁeld in the last Session Transition element transmitted to a responder is l, the initiator behaves as described in 10.32.22.
  1032.4 On-channel Tunneling (OCT) operation  OCT allows a STA of a multi-band capable device to transmit an MMPDU that was constructed by a different STA ofthe same device. An MMPDU transmitted this way is referred to as an OCT MMPDU. The MLME ofthe nontransmitting STA that constructs or is the destination ofan OCT MMPDU is referred to as an NT-MLME. The MLME ofthe STA that transmits or receives an OCT MMPDU over the air is referred to as a TR-MLME.
   NOTE7OCT can be used in conjunction with or independent from the FST setup protocol.
  Figure 10-35 depicts the overall OCT procedure. In this ﬁgure, <primitive> refers to the name of any ofthe MLME primitives deﬁned in 6.3 that meets all ofthe following conditions:
 7 Deﬁnes request, indication, response, and conﬁrm primitives, or just request and indication primitives.
 7 Includes a peer Multi-band element. The peer Multi-band element is used to identify the peer NT- MLME.

  10.33 MMSL cluster operation 1033.1 Introduction  A STA is MMSL cluster capable if it includes an MMS element in its most recent transmission of (Re)Association Request, (Re)Association Response, ADDTS Request, ADDTS Response, Probe Request, Probe Response, Information Request, or Infomiation Response frames.
  An MM-SME coordinated STA shall be MMSL cluster capable, except for an MM-SME that coordinates two STAs where one STA is a member PCP/AP in a centralized PCP/AP cluster and the other STA is associated to the S-AP ofthe centralized PCP/AP cluster.
  NOTEiln the centralized clustering case, the two STAs in the MM-SME are communicating with different MAC entities with different SMEs, so there is no individual link for MMSL.
   A non-MM-SME coordinated STA may be MMSL cluster capable.
  An MMSL cluster capable STA shall include an MMS element in transmitted (Re)Association Request and (Re)Association Response frames.
   As described in 4.9.3, an MM-SME may coordinate multiple MACs (and their respective STAs).
  Each STA coordinated by the same MM-SME may be used for the MMSL cluster setup and maintenance.
  The PCP may deliver an MMS element that includes a MAC address that is equal to the BSSID and other MAC addresses that are not equal to the BSSID. The MAC addresses that are not the BSSID shall not be used to request and respond to association, reassociation, probing, and scheduling services provided by the PCP.
  If a non-PCP/non-AP STA has delivered an MMS element to the PCP/AP, the non-PCP/non-AP STA shall not send an ADDTS Request frame to the PCP/AP with the TA ﬁeld equal to a MAC address that was not included in the delivered MMS element.
  If an MM-SME coordinated STA is associated with a PCP/AP that allocates one single AID to all STAs advertised in the MMS element sent by the MM-SME coordinated STA, the AID can be also used to identify the MMSL cluster. Ifthe AID is provided for one ofthe advertised STAs ofthe MM-SME coordinated STA, then the same AID applies to all STAs whose addresses are referenced in the delivered MMS element and the Single AID ﬁeld is set as per Table 8-183t.
   Table 10-17 covers the possible cases ofthe AID use for MMSL cluster identiﬁcation.

The MMS Control ﬁeld within the MMS element included in the Association Request and Response frame should be asserted as per 8.4.2.155. If the PCP/AP is not an MM-SME coordinated STA, the PCP/AP shall include the MMS element received from the non- PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA in the Association Response frame sent as response. If the PCP/ AP is an MM-SME coordinated STA, the PCP/AP should include its own MMS element that contain its advertised MAC entities in the Association Response frame and shall not include the MMS element received from the non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA in the Association Response frame. The PCP/AP shall not respond with any MMS element ifit is not MMSL cluster capable.

  An ADDTS Request/Response frame exchange with a PTP TSPEC shall be used to establish the MMSL cluster between non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STAs and between a non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA and a non-PCP/non-AP non-MM-SME coordinated STA.
  A non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA shall include an MMS element that contains its advertised MAC entities in transmitted ADDTS Request frames. The MMS Control ﬁeld within the transmitted MMS element should be assened as per 8.4.2.155. If the non-PCP/non-AP STA is not an MM-SME coordinated STA, the non-PCP/non-AP STA should include the MMS element with the MMS Element Owner ﬁeld set to “no Owner" in the ADDTS Request frame.
      The non-PCP/non-AP MM-SME coordinated STA shall include its own MMS element that contain ts advertised MAC entities in transmitted ADDTS Response frames. The MMS Control ﬁeld within the transmitted MMS element should be asserted as per 8.4.2.155. The non-MM-SME coordinated STA may include the MMS element of the MM-SME coordinated STA from which it received an ADDTS Request frame in the ADDTS Response sent as response. The non-MM-SME coordinated STA shall not respond with any MMS element ifit is not MMSL cluster capable.
      The setup ofthe MMSL cluster fails ifthe ADDTS Response does not contain the MMS element.
  10.34 DMG coexistence with nan-IEEE-802.11 systems  This subclause describes the features available in this standard to improve coexistence with other DMG systems, including IEEE Std 802.15.3cTM.
  The same common channelization that is defined in other DMG standards and speciﬁcations is adopted (21.3.1). In regulatory domains where 2 or more channels are deﬁned, a DMG STA should support at least 2 channels.
  An AP should not start an infrastructure BSS on a channel where the signal level is at or above  aDMGDetectionThres or upon detecting a valid IEEE 802.15.3c CMS preamble at a receive level equal to or greater than 760 dBm.
      

page 440
lEEE  If a DMG STA is capable of performing directional channel measurements [10.31) to detect non- IEEE-802.11 transmissions on a channel, it can report the results ofthe measurements to the DMG STA’s PCP/AP.
  Ifa DMG STA detects a non-IEEE-802.11 transmission on its channel or if the PCP/AP receives a report (10.11) from a DMG STA on a non-IEEE-802.11 transmission, the following mechanisms might be used to mitigate interference:
7 Change operating channel [10.9) 7 Beamforming (9.35) 7 Reduce transmit power (10.8) 7 Perform FST (10.32) 7 Move the TBTT (10.302), and thus the beacon interval, in the case of an AP or PCP 7 Change the schedule of SPs and CBAPs in the beacon interval (8.4.2.134) in the case of an AP or PCP 7 Defer transmission for a later time 7 For periods oftime in the beacon interval where the DMG STA experiences poor channel quality, the DMG STA can use the TSCONST ﬁeld within the DMG TSPEC element (8.4.2.136) to request  its PCP/AP to avoid scheduling an SP for that DMG STA during those periods oftime in the beacon interval.
  10.35 DMG relay procedures 1035.1 General  Relaying allows a source relay endpoint DMG STA (REDS) to transmit frames to a destination REDS with the assistance of another DMG STA called the relay DMG STA (RDS). Relaying can improve the reliability of communication in a DMG BSS in case the direct link between the source REDS and the destination REDS is disrupted.
  A STA is a REDS if both dot1 lREDSActivated and dotl lRelayActivated are true. A REDS shall set the Relay Usability ﬁeld within its Relay Capabilities element to l. A STA is an RDS if both dotllRDSActivated and dotllRelayActivated are true. An RDS shall set the Relay Supportability ﬁeld within its Relay Capabilities element to 1. A STA is relay capable if dotl lRelayActivated is true and it is either a REDS or an RDS or both, and it is relay incapable otherwise.
  A relay capable STA shall advertise its capability by including the Relay Capabilities element in (Re)Association Request, (Re)Association Response, Probe Request, Probe Response, Information Request, and Information Response frames. An AP or relay capable PCP may include the Relay Capabilities element in DMG Beacon frames.
  For a STA to operate as a REDS or an RDS in an Infrastructure BSS or PBSS, the following conditions shall be met:
   7 The STA is a member ofthe Infrastructure BSS or PBSS.
  7 The TDDTI ﬁeld within the DMG STA Capabilities element ofthe PCP/AP ofthe BSS is 1.
  7 The Relay pemrission ﬁeld within the Relay Capabilities element ofthe PCP/AP ofthe BSS is 1.
  After an RDS selection through the common relay setup procedures deﬁned in 10.352 and prior to data  frame transmission, a source REDS, a destination REDS and an RDS shall establish pair-wise authentication among these STAs ifthe dot11RSNAEnabled variable for any ofthese STAs is true.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  A source REDS, a destination REDS and an RDS can establish the types of relay operation as specified in 9.39.
  As needed, in the following subclauses, source REDS, RDS, and destination REDS are expressed as ‘S‘, ‘R’, and ‘D’, respectively. Also, a direct link between STA S and STA D can be simply referred to as ‘S-D’ link.
  1035.2 Common relay setup procedures 10.35.11 Introduction  This subclause describes the procedures that a source REDS, a destination REDS, and an RDS employ to set up a relay operation among these STAs. These procedures are used for both link switching and link cooperating relays, and shall be performed in the order shown in this subclause.
  10.35.22 Relay capabilities and RDS discovery procedures  A source REDS can obtain the capabilities ofother STAs in the BSS following the STA’s association with the BSS or with the transmission ofan Information Request frame as described in 1019.1.
  A source DMG STA that intends to set up relay operation with a destination DMG STA shall obtain the capabilities of the destination DMG STA prior to initiating the relay setup procedure with the destination DMG STA. The source DMG STA may attempt to set up relay operation with the destination DMG STA only if both the source DMG STA and destination DMG STA are REDS, and there exists at least one RDS in the BSS.
  Upon receiving an MLME-RELAYSearch.request primitive, the source DMG STA can discover a list of RDSs in the BSS by transmitting a Relay Search Request frame to the PCP/AP with the destination REDS AID field set to the AID of the destination DMG STA. The MLME ofthe PCP/AP receiving a Relay Search Request frame sliall generate an MLME-RELAYSearch.indication primitive. Upon receiving an MLME- RELAYSearch.response primitive, the PCP/AP sliall transmit a Relay Search Response frame addressed to the requesting STA and shall include in the transmitted frame a list of RDSs in the BSS. The MLME of the source DMG STA receiving a Relay Search Response frame shall generate an MLME- RELAYSearchconfinn primitive. After the transmission ofthe Relay Search Response frame to the source DMG STA, the PCP/AP shall transmit an unsolicited Relay Search Response frame to the destination DMG STA with the Relay Capable STA Info field ofthe source DMG STA and the list of RDSs that the PCP/AP included in the last Relay Search Response frame transmitted to the source DMG STA.
  10.35.23 RDS selection procedure  Following the transmission of a Relay Search Response frame, the PCP/AP should schedule within its Extended Schedule element two SPs for each RDS included in the transmitted Relay Search Response frame:
  7 An SP having as source DMG STA the source REDS and as destination DMG STA the RDS, and with the Beamfonning Training field set to l. The duration ofthe SP should be such that the source REDS and RDS can complete BF as described in 9.35.
  7 An SP having as source DMG STA the RDS and as destination DMG STA the destination REDS, and with the Beamfomiing Training field set to l. The duration of the SP should be such that the RDS and the destination REDS can complete BF as described in 9.35.
  After the RDS completes BF with both the source REDS and destination REDS, the source REDS shall send  a Multi-Relay Channel Measurement Request frame to the RDS, which shall respond with the transmission ofa Multi-Relay Cliannel Measurement Report frame back to the source REDS. Following the reception of      

page 442
lEEE  this frame, the source REDS should perform BF with the destination REDS as described in 9.35, and once BF is completed the source REDS shall transmit a Multi-Relay Channel Measurement Request frame to the destination REDS. In response, the destination REDS shall transmit a Multi-Relay Channel Measurement Report frame to the source REDS including the channel measurement information between the destination REDS and all RDSs known to the destination REDS. To shorten the time it takes to complete this procedure, STAs can limit BF to the SLS phase only.
  Once this procedure is completed, the source REDS becomes aware of all the channel measurement information between the source REDS and zero or more RDSs and between the destination REDS and zero or more RDSs. The source REDS shall then select a single STA to operate as the RDS between the source REDS and the destination REDS. The selection of the RDS is implementation-dependent, and it can be based on information contained within an RDS’s Relay capability element and channel measurements.
  10.35.14 RLS procedure  Following the selection of the RDS to be used between the source REDS and the destination REDS, the source REDS receiving an MLME-RLS.request primitive initiates the RLS procedure by sending an RLS Request frame to the selected RDS. The RLS Request frame includes the capabilities and the AIDs of the source REDS, the destination REDS, and the RDS, and the relay transfer parameter set. Upon receiving the RLS Request frame, the RDS shall transmit an RLS Request frame to the destination REDS containing the same information as received within the frame body of the source REDS’s RLS Request frame.
  The MLME of the destination REDS receiving a Relay Search Request frame shall generate an MLME- RLS.indication primitive. Upon receiving an MLME-RLS.response primitive, the destination REDS shall transmit an RLS Response frame to the RDS with the destination status code ﬁeld set to SUCCESS if the destination REDS is willing to participate in the RLS, and set to 37 (“The request has been declined") ifthe destination REDS is not willing to participate in the RLS. Upon receiving the RLS Response frame, the RDS shall transmit an RLS Response frame to the source REDS containing the same infonnation as received within the destination REDS’s RLS Response frame, with the exception that the RDS shall set the relay status code ﬁeld to SUCCESS if the RDS is willing to participate in the RLS, and shall set it to 37 (“The request has been declined") ifthe RDS is not willing to participate in the RLS.
  The MLME of the source DMG STA receiving an RLS Response frame from the RDS shall generate an MLME-RLS.conf1rm primitive. Upon receiving an RLS Response frame with the destination status code and relay status code fields set to SUCCESS, the source DMG STA may transmit an RLS Announcement frame to the PCP/AP to indicate that the RLS procedure was successfully completed. If either or both of the destination status code and relay status code fields are nonzero, the RLS procedure is unsuccessful.
  Upon the completion of RLS procedure, the source REDS, the destination REDS, and the RDS can redo BF among them.
  10.35.25 Relay operation-type change procedure  The source REDS may change the relay operation type from link switching to link cooperating, and vice- versa, if either one of S-D, or S-R, or R-D links becomes unavailable or for other reasons. Link unavailability can be determined by the source DMG STA not receiving expected frames from the destination REDS. To assist in this decision, the source REDS can use the link adaptation procedure (9.39.4) to obtain the quality ofa link.
  To change the relay operation type within an SP from link cooperating to link switching in a case that the S- D link becomes unavailable, the source REDS shall transmit a ROC Request frame to the RDS with the link cooperating subfield set to 0 and the relay-link subfield set to 1. Upon receiving a ROC Request frame, the RDS shall transmit a ROC Request frame to the destination REDS containing the same infomiation as received within the frame body of the source REDS’s ROC Request frame. Following the reception of a      

page 443
lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  ROC Request frame, the destination REDS shall respond with a ROC Response frame to the RDS with the status code ﬁeld set to SUCCESS if the destination REDS accepts to change the operation into link switching, and set to 37 (“The request has been declined") ifthe destination REDS rejects the request. Upon receiving the ROC Response fratne, the RDS shall transmit a ROC Response to the source REDS with the status code ﬁeld set to SUCCESS only if the RDS accepts to change the operation into link switching and the status code ﬁeld set to SUCCESS in the ROC Response frame received from destination REDS.
 Otherwise, the RDS shall set the status code ﬁeld to 37 (“The request has been declined"). Upon reception of a ROC Response frotn the RDS with the status code ﬁeld set to SUCCESS, the source REDS immediately starts to transmit frames to the destination REDS via the RDS relay link.
  To change the relay operation type from link cooperating to link switching in other case that the S-R link becomes unavailable, the source REDS shall a ROC Request frame to the destination REDS with the link cooperating subﬁeld set to 0 and the relay-link subﬁeld set to 0. Following the reception ofa ROC Request fratne, the destination REDS shall respond with a ROC Response frame to the source REDS with the status code ﬁeld indicating the acceptance or rejection of the request. Upon reception of a ROC Response frotn the destination REDS with the status code ﬁeld set to SUCCESS, the source REDS starts to transmit frames to the destination REDS via the direct link in link switching mode.
  To change the relay operation type within an SP from link switching to link cooperating, the source REDS shall transmit a ROC Request frame to the destination REDS via the RDS with the link cooperating subﬁeld set to 1. Following the reception ofa ROC Request frame from the RDS, the destination REDS shall respond with a ROC Response frame to the source REDS via the RDS with the status code ﬁeld indicating the acceptance or rejection of the request. Upon reception of a ROC Response frame frotn the RDS with the status code ﬁeld set to SUCCESS, the source REDS immediately starts to transmit frames to the destination REDS using the RDS in link cooperating mode. Ifa TPA procedure was not perfomied beforehand since the link switching operation has been continued from the start of relay operation, the STA shall perform the TPA procedure before transmitting using link cooperating mode.
  NOTEiAs described in 9,393.23, during the SI’ in link cooperating operation the destination REDS has its receive antenna pattent such that it simultaneously covers the links towards both the source REDS and the RDS,  1035.4 Relay teardown  A source REDS that has successfully completed the RLS procedure with a destination REDS may teardown the relay operation between the source REDS, destination REDS and RDS. To do that, the source REDS shall transmit an RLS Teardown frame to the RDS, destination REDS and PCP/AP ofthe BSS. Within the RLS Teardoth frame, the source REDS shall set the source AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe source REDS, the destination AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe destination REDS and the relay AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe RDS.
  A RDS may teardown the relay operation between the source REDS, destination REDS and RDS. To do that, the RDS shall transmit an RLS Teardoth frame to the source REDS, destination REDS and PCP/AP of the BSS. Within the RLS Teardown frame, the RDS shall set the source AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe source REDS, the destination AID ﬁeld to the AID ofthe destination REDS and the relay AID ﬁeld to the AID of the RDS.

  a) If both the requester and responder APs are QAB capable as indicated by the QAB Capability ﬁeld within the Extended Capabilities element, the requester AP sends a QAB Request frame indicating the duration, period, offset, and number of the quiet intervals. The requester AP may include multiple Quiet Period Request elements in one frame targeting multiple responder APs.
  b) Ifa QAB Response frame is received with the matching dialog token and request token with a status code set to a value of SUCCESS, the AP has conﬁrmed the responder AP has scheduled the requested quiet periods, and the MLME shall issue an MLME-QAB.conﬁnn primitive indicating the success ofthe procedure.
  c) Ifa QAB Response frame is received with the matching dialog and request token with a status code set to a value other than SUCCESS, the procedure is considered to have failed, and the MLME shall issue an MLME-QAB.conﬁmi primitive indicating the failure ofthe procedure.
  d) If there is no response from the recipient within dotl lQABTimeout, the MLME shall issue an  MLME-QAB.conﬁrm primitive indicating the failure of the procedure with a result code of TIMEOUT.
   NOTﬁiThe GAS protocol can be used by an AP to verify the capabilities ofanolhet AP.
10.36.25 Procedure at the responder AP   A responder AP shall operate as follows (Figure 10-36):
 a) When a QAB.Request frame matching the BSSID is received from another AP, the MLME shall issue an MLME-QAB.indication primitive.
 b) Upon receipt of the MLME-QAB.response primitive, the AP shall respond by transmitting a QAB Response frame.
  1) If the result code is SUCCESS, the request is accepted. The AP shall use SPs to schedule the quiet period[s) according to the accepted request. The SPs shall have the AP as both source and destination and the AP shall not transmit during the SP. The QAB procedure shall be temiinated if the number of quiet intervals exceeds the value of the Repetition Count ﬁeld specified. Contained in the transmitted QAB Response frame is the copy of the request token and the BSSID ofthe AP.
   2) lfthe result code is REJECTED, the request has not been fulfilled.
  10.37 DMG beamforming  Upon receipt of an MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive, a STA shall undertake beamforming training with the STA indicated by the PeerSTAAddress parameter according to the procedures defined in 9.35. This training shall start with the SLS and shall include the BRP if and only if the RequestBRP parameter of the MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive is true.
  A STA receiving MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive may act as either initiator or responder in the beamfomiing training.
  If the STA indicated by the PeerSTAAddress parameter of a received MLME-BF-TRAINING.request primitive is a PCP or AP of a BSS in which a STA is a member, the STA receiving the MLME-BF- TRAINING.request primitive may perform beamforming training during the A-BFT as described in 9.35.5.

  GCMP is based on the GCM of the AES encryption algorithm. GCM combines Galois/Counter Mode for data conﬁdentiality and GMAC for authentication and integrity. GCM protects the integrity of both the MPDU Data ﬁeld and selected portions ofthe MPDU header.
  The AES algorithm is deﬁned in FIPS PUB 197-2001. All AES processing used within GCMP uses AES with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size.
      

page 452
lEEE  GCM is deﬁned in NIST Special Publication 800-38D. GCM is a generic mode that can be used with any block-oriented encryption algorithm.
  GCM requires a fresh temporal key for every session. GCM also requires a unique nonce value for each frame protected by a given temporal key, and GCMP uses a 96-bit hence that includes a 48-bit packet number (PN) for this purpose. Reuse of a PN with the same temporal key voids all security guarantees.
  GCMP uses a 128-bit MIC.
   Annex M provides test vectors for GCM.
  When GCMP is selected as the RSN pairwise cipher and management ﬁame protection is negotiated, individually addressed robust management frames shall be protected with GCMP.

 a) Increment the PN, to obtain a fresh PN for each MPDU, so that the PN never repeats for the same temporal key.
   NOTEikelransmilled Ml’DUs are not modiﬁed on retransmission.
   b) Use the ﬁelds in the MPDU header to constmct the additional authentication data (AAD) for GCM.
 The GCM algorithm provides integrity protection for the ﬁelds included in the AAD. MPDU header ﬁelds that may change when retransmitted are masked to 0 when calculating the AAD.
   c) Construct the GCM Nonce block from the PN and A2, where A2 is MPDU Address 2.
  d) Place the new PN and the key identiﬁer into the 8-0ctet GCMP IIeader.
  e) Use the temporal key, AAD, nonce. and MPDU data to fomi the cipher text and MIC. This step is known as GCM originator processing.
  0 Form the encrypted MPDU by combining the original MPDU header, the GCMP header, the encrypted data and MIC, as described in 1 1.4.5.2.
  The GCM reference describes the processing of the key, nonce, AAD, and data to produce the encrypted output. See 11.4.5.3.2 to 11.4.5.3.6 for details ofthe creation ofthe AAD and nonce from the MPDU and the associated MPDU-speciﬁc processing.
  11.4.5.3.2 PN processing   Each transmitter shall maintain a single PN (48-bit counter) for each PTKSA, GTKSA, and STKSA.
  The PN shall be implemented as a 48-bit monotonically incrementing non-negative integer, initialized to 1 when the corresponding temporal key is initialized or refreshed.
  The PN is incremented by a positive number for each MPDU. The PN shall never repeat for a series of encrypted MPDUs using the same temporal key.
  If the PN is larger than the value of dotl lPNExhaustionThreshold, an MLME-PN-Exhaustion.indication primitive shall be generated.

  11.4.5.3.6 GCM originator processing  GCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode, and in this standard, GCM is used with the AES block cipher.
   There are four inputs to GCM originator processing:
  a) Key.- the temporal key [16 octets).
  b) Nam'e' the nonce (12 octets) constmcted as described in 11.4.5.3.4.
  c) Frame body the frame body of the MPDU.
  d) AAD: the AAD [22-30 octets) constructed from the MPDU header as described in 11.4.5.3.3.
  The GCM originator processing provides authentication and integrity of the frame body and the AAD as well as data conﬁdentiality of the frame body. The output from the GCM originator processing consists of the encrypted data and 16 additional octets of encrypted MIC.
   A GCMP protected individually addressed robust management frame shall be protected with the TK.

   a) The encrypted MPDU is parsed to construct the AAD and nonce values.
  b) The AAD is fonned from the MPDU header ofthe encrypted MPDU.
  c) The Nonce value is constmcted from the A2 and PN ﬁelds.
   d) The MIC is extracted for use in the GCM integrity checking.
  e) The GCM recipient processing uses the temporal key, AAD, nonce, MIC, and MPDU cipher text data to recover the MPDU plaintext data as well as to check the integrity of the AAD and MPDU plaintext data.
  0 The received MPDU header and the MPDU plaintext data from the GCM recipient processing may be concatenated to form a plaintext MPDU.
  g) The decryption processing prevents replay of MPDUs by validating that the PN in the MPDU is greater than the replay counter maintained for the session.
   See 11.4.5.4.2 through 11.4.5.4.4 for details ofthis processing.
  When the received frame is a GCMP protected individually addressed robust management frame, the contents of the MMPDU body after protection is removed and shall be delivered to the MLME rather than through the MA-UNITDATA.indication primitive.
  11.4.5.4.2 GCM recipient processing  GCM recipient processing shall use the same parameters as GCM originator processing. A GCMP protected individually addressed robust management frame shall use the same TK as a Data MPDU.
   There are four inputs to GCM recipient processing:
  7 Key.- the temporal key [16 octets).
  7 Nance' the nonce (12 octets) constructed as described in 11.4.5.3.4.
  7 Encrypted frame body.- the encrypted frame body from the received MPDU. The encrypted frame body includes a lé-octet MIC.
   7 AAD: the AAD (22-30 octets) that is the canonical MPDU header as described in 11.4.5.3.3.
  The GCM recipient processing checks the authentication and integrity of the frame body and the AAD as well as decrypting the frame body. The plaintext is returned only ifthe MIC check is successful.

lEEE  Std 802.11ad-2012     There is one output from error-free GCM recipient processing:
   Frame body: the plaintext frame body, which is 16 octets smaller than the encrypted frame body.
  11.4.5.4.3 Decrypted GCMP MPDU  The decapsulation process succeeds when the calculated MIC matches the MIC value obtained from decrypting the received encrypted MPDU. The original MPDU header is concatenated with the plaintext data resulting from the successful GCM recipient processing to create the plaintext MPDU.
  11.4.5.4.4 PM and replay detection  To effect replay detection, the receiver extracts the PN from the GCMP header. See 11.4.5.2 for a description ofhow the PN is encoded in the GCMP header. The following processing rules are used to detect   replay:
8) b)  C)  d)  c)  426   The PN values sequentially number each MPDU.
  A receiver shall maintain a separate set of PN replay counters for each PTKSA, GTKSA, and STKSA. The receiver initializes these replay counters to 0 when it resets the temporal key for a peer.
  The replay counter is set to the PN value ofaccepted GCMP MPDUs.
  For each PTKSA, GTKSA, and STKSA, the recipient shall maintain a separate replay counter for each possible IEEE 802.11 MSDU or A-MSDU priority (including, for example, each possible TID) and shall use the PN recovered from a received frame to detect replayed frames. A replayed frame occurs when the PN extracted from a received frame is less than or equal to the current replay counter value for the frame’s MSDU or A-MSDU priority (including, for example, each possible TID) and frame type.
  For each IGTKSA the recipient shall maintain a single replay counter for protected group addressed robust management frames, and shall compare the IPN recovered from a received, protected group addressed robust management frame to the replay counter to detect replayed frames as described above for data frames.
  If dotl lRSNAProtectedManagementFramesActivated is true, the recipient shall maintain a single replay counter for received individually addressed robust management frames within the context of each Protected Management frame pairing and shall use the PN from the received frame to detect replays. A replayed frame occurs when the PN from the frame is less than or equal to the current management frame replay counter value corresponding to the TA of the received management frame. The transmitter shall preserve the order of protected robust management frames sent to the same DA.
  A receiver shall discard any data MPDU that is received with its PN less than or equal to the value of the replay counter that is associated with the TA and priority of the received MPDU. If dotl lRSNAProtectedManagementFramesActivated is true, a receiver shall discard any group addressed MMPDU that is received with its PN less than or equal to the value ofthe replay counter associated with group addressed MMPDUs. If dotl lRSNAProtectedManagementFramesActivated is true, the receiver shall discard any individually addressed robust MMPDU that is received with its PN less than or equal to the value ofthe replay counter associated with the TA ofthat individually addressed MMPDU. When discarding a frame, the receiver shall increment by 1 the value of dotl lRSNAStatsGCMPReplays for data frames or dotl lRSNAStatsRobustMgthCMPReplays for robust management frames.
  For MSDUs or A-MSDUs sent using the Block Ack feature, reordering of received MSDUs or A- MSDUs according to the Block Ack receiver operation (described in 9.21.4) is performed prior to replay detection.

  The PTKSA is a result of the 4-Way Handshake, FT 4-Way Handshake, FT Protocol, or FT Resource Request Protocol. This security association is also bidirectional. PTKSAs are cached for the life of the PMKSA or PMK-Rl security association. Because the PTKSA is tied to the PMKSA or to a PMK-Rl security association, it only has the additional infomiation from the 4—Way Handshake. For the PTKSA derived as a result ofthe 4-Way Handshake, there shall be only one PTKSA per band see 11.5.19 with the same Supplicant and Authenticator MAC addresses.

  a) The STA selects an authorized PBSS by identifying a peer from a DMG Beacon, Announce, Probe Response, or lnt'onnation Response frames.
   b) A STA may associate with a peer if the peer is a PCP.
  c) If authentication is required, the STA or the peer initiates IEEE 802.1X authentication. The EAP method used by IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 shall support mutual authentication.
  d) The last step is key management. The authentication process creates cryptographic keys shared between the IEEE 802.1X AS and the STA. The AS transfers these keys to the peer and the peer and the STA use one of the key conﬁrmation handshakes, e.g., the 4-Way Handshake or FT 4-Way Handshake, to complete security association establishment. The key contimiation handshake indicates when the link has been secured by the keys and is ready to allow data traffic and protected robust management trames.

The included RSNE shall specify all the authentication and cipher suites enabled by the STA’s policy. A STA shall not advertise any authentication or cipher suite that is not enabled.
  The SME shall utilize the MLME-SCAN.request primitive to identify neighboring STAs that assert robust security and advertise an SSID identifying an authorized ESS PBSS or IBSS. A STA may decline to communicate with STAs that fail to advertise an RSNE in their Beacon Information Response and Probe Response frames or that do not advertise an authorized SSID. A STA may also decline to communicate with other STAs that do not advertise authorized authentication and cipher suites within their RSNEs.

11.5.7a RSNA policy selection in a PBSS  RSNA policy selection in a PBSS utilizes the association procedure (10.3.1) ifthe initiating STA chooses to associate with a PCP. RSNA policy selection is performed by the associating STA. The STA does this by including an RSNE in its [Re)Association Requests.
  The STA follows the procedures in 11.4.3 to select RSNA policy with the PCP, with the PCP taking the role of the AP. If the initiating STA chooses not to associate with a peer in a PBSS, it follows the procedures in 11.4.5 to select RSNA policy with the peer.

 This signals the Supplicant that the MAC has transitioned from the disabled to enabled state. At this point, the Supplicant’s Controlled Port is blocked, and communication of all non-IEEE-802.1X MSDUs sent or received via the port is not authorized.
     In an ESS/PBSS if the PCP/AP associates with a STA, the ﬂAP indicates that the IEEE 802.11 link is available by invoking the MLME-ASSOCIATE.indication or MLME-REASSOCIATE.indication primitive.
 At this point the Authenticator’s Controlled Port corresponding to the STA’s association is blocked, and communication ofall non-IEEE-802.1X MSDUs sent or received via the Controlled Port is not authorized.
     In an IBSS, the STA shall block all IEEE 802.1X ports at initialization. Communication of all non-IEEE- 802.1X MSDUs sent or received via the Controlled Port is not authorized.
  In a PBSS ifa STA chooses not to associate with the PCP the STA shall block all IEEE 802.1X ports at  initialization. Communication of all non-IEEE-802.1X MSDUs sent or received via the Controlled Port is not authorized.

IEEE  When a STKSA is deleted, the STAil may establish a new STSL with the STAiP. Ifthe SMK between the STA pair has not expired, the STAil may initiate a 4-Way Handshake and create a new STKSA with STAiP. Ifthe SMK has expired, the STAil shall create both a new SMKSA and a new STKSA with the STA P.
  An Authenticator/STAJ may initiate a 4-Way IIandshake for the purpose of renewing the key associated with a PTKSA or STKSA. A supplicant/STAiP may send an EAPOL request message to the authenticator/ STAil to request rekeying. In addition, ifboth the Authenticator and the Supplicant support multiple keys for individually addressed traffic, a smooth switchover to the new key is possible using the following procedure.
  The $02.11 MAC shall issue an MLME-PN-Warning.indication primitive when the Packet Number assignment for a particular PTKSA, GTKSA, or STKSA reaches or exceeds dotl lPNWaniingThreshold for the ﬁrst time. The indication shall be issued only once for a given PTKSA, GTKSA, or STKSA. The SME may use the indication as a trigger to establish a new PTKSA, GTKSA, or STKSA before the Packet Number space is exhausted.
  A PTKSA or STKSA has a limited lifetime, either in absolute time or due to exhausting the PN space. To maintain an uninterrupted security association, a STA should establish a new PTKSA or STKSA prior to the expiry ofthe old PTKSA or STKSA.
  When both ends of the link support the expanded Key ID space for individually addressed trafﬁc, it is possible to install the new PTKSA or STKSA without data loss, provided the new PTKSA or STKSA uses a different Key ID from the old PTKSA or STKSA. Data loss might occur ifthe same Key ID is used because it is not possible to precisely coordinate [due to software processing delays) when the new key is used for transmit at one end and when it is applied to receive at the other end. Ifa different Key ID is used for the new PTKSA or STKSA, then provided the new key i ' stalled at the receive side prior to its first use at the transmit side there is no need for precise coordination. During the transition, received packets are unambiguously identiﬁed using the Key ID as belonging to either the old or new PTKSA or STKSA.
     11.5.19 Multi-band RSNA 11.5.19.1 General  A STA is multi-band capable and RSNA-capable if the values of both its local MIB variables dotl lMultibandImplemented and dot] lRSNAEnabled are true.
  A STA that is multi-band capable and RSNA-capable shall set the Pairwise Cipher Suite Present ﬁeld ofthe Multi-band element to 1 and shall include the Pairwise Cipher Suite Count ﬁeld and the Pairwise Cipher Suite List ﬁeld in the Multi-band element. The STA may include the RSNE and the Multi-band element in the DMG Beacon and Announce frames and shall include the RSNE and the Multi-band element in Beacon, Probe Response, and Infomiation Response frames. The included RSNE shall specify all the authentication and cipher suites enabled by the STA’s policy for the band where this element is transmitted, and the included Multi-band element shall specify all the pairwise cipher suites enabled by the STA’s policy for the band speciﬁed within the Multi-band element. A STA shall not advertise any cipher suite that is not enabled.
  A multi-band capable and RSNA-capable STA shall include the Multi-band element in the (Re)Association Request frame and in Message 2 and Message 3 ofthe 4-Way IIandshake.
  In order to set up an RSNA with a peer STA for a supported band/channel, a STA that does not know the peer’s policy for the band/channel shall ﬁrst obtain the peer STA’s policy for the supported band/channel by using a Probe Request frame or Information Request frame. The STA initiating RSNA establishment for a supported band/channel is called RSNA initiator, and the targeted STA ofthe RSNA establishment is called RSNA responder.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  A multi-band capable device can create its own group key(s) for one or more supported bands/channels. If the STA uses different MAC addresses in different bands/channels, different GTKSAs shall be created for different bands. If the STA uses a same MAC address in all supported bands/channels, a single GTKSA shall be created for all supported bands/channels.
  If the pairwise and group cipher suites used by a pair of multi-band capable devices to communicate with each other in the current operating band/channel is also supported after the transfer to another band/channel that was performed using transparent FST, the devices shall continue using the same cipher suites to communicate with each other after the transfer. In all other cases, a separate RSNA has to be established for the other band/channel (see 11.5.19).
  11.5.19.2 Nantransparent multi-band RSNA  An RSNA initiator can establish a nontransparent [10.32) multi-band RSNA with an RSNA responder for a supported band/channel other than the current operating band/channel. The two STAs use the same PMKSA for both the supported band/channel and the current operating band/channel and create different PTKSAs for different bands/channels.
  lfthe RSNA initiator does not have an existing PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the RSNA initiator shall ﬁrst establish a PMKSA with the RSNA responder in the current operating band/channel and then use the PMKSA to create a PTKSA with the RSNA responder for the supported band/channel. lfthe RSNA initiator has already established a PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the PMKSA shall be used to create a PTKSA between the two STAs for the supported band/channel.
  With the PMK in place, the RSNA initiator and RSNA responder can proceed in two ways depending on the setting ofthe Joint Multi-band RSNA subﬁeld within the RSN Capabilities ﬁeld in the RSNE ofboth STAs.
  If the Joint Multi-band RSNA subﬁeld within the RSN Capabilities ﬁeld of either the RSNA initiator or RSNA responder is 0, the STA pair uses a 4-Way Ilandshake to establish a PTKSA for the current band/ channel and may start a separate 4-Way Ilandshake in the current operating band/channel to negotiate a pairwise cipher suite for the supported band/channel and establish a PTKSA for the supported band/channel.
 As speciﬁed in 11.6.6, Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way Handshake convey the Multi-band element associated with the supported band/channel. The Multi-band element in Message 2 includes the selected pairwise cipher suite for the supported band/channel. Message 3 includes the Multi-band element that the STA would send in a Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, Probe Response, or Information Response frame.
 Message 3 may optionally include a second Multi-band element that indicates the STA’s pairwise cipher suite assignment for the supported band/channel.
  lfthe Joint Multi-band RSNA subﬁeld within the RSN Capabilities ﬁeld is 1 for both the RSNA initiator and the RSNA responder and at least one of the STAs uses different MAC addresses for different bands/ channels, the STAs shall use a single 4-Way Ilandshake to negotiate pairwise cipher suites and establish PTKSAs for both the current operating band/channel and the other supported band[s)/channel(s). As speciﬁed in 11.6.6, Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way Ilandshake convey the RSNE and the Multi- band element(s). The RSNE in Message 2 includes the selected pairwise cipher suite for the current operating band/channel, and the Multi-band element(s) in Message 2 includes the selected pairwise cipher suite[s) for the other supported band(s)/channel[s). Message 3 includes the RSNE and the Multi-band element(s) that the STA would send in a Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, Probe Response, or Information Response frame. Message 3 may optionally include a second RSNE and Multi-band element(s) that indicate the STA’s pairwise cipher suite assignments for the current operating band/channel and the other supported band[s)/channel(s). KCK and KEK associated with the current operating band/channel shall be used in the 4-Way Ilandshake.

lEEE  11.5.19.3 Transparent multi-band RSNA  An RSNA initiator can establish a transparent (10.32) multi-band RSNA with an RSNA responder for both the current operating band/channel and the other supported band(s)/channel(s) if  a) Both STAs use the same MAC address in the current operating band/channel and the other supported band[s)/channel(s); and  b) At least one common pairwise cipher suite is supported by both STAs in the current operating band/ channel and the other supported band(s)/cliannel(s).
  Two STAs that establish a transparent multi-band RSNA create one PMKSA and one PTKSA for both the current operating band/channel and other supported band[s)/channel.
  A STA shall use a single PN counter (11.4.3.3 and 11.4.5.3) for transmission in both the current operating band and the other supported band(s) when transparent multi-band RSNA is used.
  Ifthe RSNA initiator does not have an existing PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the RSNA initiator shall ﬁrst establish a PMKSA with the RSNA responder in the current operating band/channel and then use the PMKSA to create a PTKSA with the RSNA responder for all involved bands/channels. Ifthe RSNA initiator has already established a PMKSA with the RSNA responder, the PMKSA shall be used to create a PTKSA between the two STAs for all involved bands/channels.
  With the PMK in place, the STA pair shall use a single 4-Way Ilandshake in the current operating band/ channel to negotiate a pairwise ciplier suite for all involved bands/channels and also establish a single PTKSA for all involved bands/channels. As specified in 11.6.6, Message 2 and Message 3 of the 4-Way Ilandsliake convey the RSNE and the Multi-band element(s). The RSNE and the Multi-band element(s) in Message 2 include one selected pairwise cipher suite for all involved bands/channels. Message 3 includes the RSNE and the Multi-band element(s) that the STA would send in a Beacon, DMG Beacon, Announce, Probe Response, or lnfonnation Response frame. Message 3 may optionally include a second RSNE and Multi-band element(s) that indicate the STA’s pairwise cipher suite assignment for all involved bands/ channels.
  11.5.19.4 Mulli-band RSNA with TDLS in a non-DMG BSS  When two multi-band capable devices operate in a non-DMG BSS and set up a TDLS direct link in the non- DMG BSS, the TDLS Peer Key IIandshake protocol can be used to create a PTKSA for use in another supported band/channel that is supported by both STAs and that was indicated within both of the STA’s Multi-band element. Only TK in PTKSA is required for the supported band/channel and it shall be equal to the TPK-TK ofthe TPK.
  If at least one ofthe peer STAs has a different MAC address in the supported band/channel from that ofthe current operating band/channel, the TDLS Peer Key llandsliake protocol may be used to establish a PTKSA for the supported band/channel. In this case, the TPK key creation method shall be used to calculate a different PTKSA in the supported band/channel: the TDLS peer MAC addres s and cipher suite shall be replaced by the MAC addresses and cipher suite indicated within the corresponding Multi-band elements contained in the TDLS Setup Request and Response frames used to establish the PTKSA for the supported band/channel.
  If two TDLS peer STAs use the same MAC addresses and pairwise cipher suites in the operating band/  channel and in the supported band/channel, the TPKSA that is acquired by the successful completion ofthe TDLS Peer Key llandshake protocol may be used as the PTKSA for the supported band/channel.

7 A control modulation using MCS O (the control PHY; see 21.4)  7 A single carrier (SC) modulation using MCS l to MCS 12 (the SC PIIY; see 21.6) and MCS 25 to MCS 31 (the low-power SC PIIY; see 21.7)  7 An OFDM modulation using MCS 13 to MCS 24 (the OFDM PIIY; sec 21.5) All these modulation methods share a common preamble (see 21.3.6).
   The services provided to the MAC by the DMG PIIY consist oftwo protocol functions, deﬁned as follows:
  a) A PIIY convergence function, which adapts the capabilities of the physical medium dependent (PMD) system to the PHY service. This function is supported by the physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP), which deﬁnes a method ofmapping the PLCP service data units (PSDU) into a framing format (PPDU) suitable for sending and receiving PSDUs between two or more STAs using the associated PMD systems.
  1:) A PMD system whose function deﬁnes the characteristics and method oftransmitting and receiving  data through a wireless medium between two or more STAs. Depending on the DMG MCSs, these STAs support a mixture of DMG SC PIIY, DMG OFDM PIIY, DMG low-power SC PIIY, and DMG control PIIY.
  21.1.2 DMG PHY functions  The DMG PHY contains three functional entities: the PHY convergence function (PLCP), the layer  management function (PLME) and the PMD function. Each of these functions is described in detail in 21.3  to 21.11. The DMG PIIY service is provided to the MAC through the PHY service primitives deﬁned in   Clause 12.
  21.1.2.1 DMG PLCP sublayer  In order to allow the MAC to operate with minimum dependence on the PMD sublayer, a PIIY convergence sublayer is defined (PLCP). The PLCP sublayer simpliﬁes the PHY service interface to the MAC services.
  21.1.2.2 DMG PMD sublayer  The DMG PMD sublayer provides a means to send and receive data between two or more STAs. This subclause is concerned with SC and OFDM modulations.
  21.1.2.3 PHY management entity (PLME)   The PLME performs management of the local PHY functions in conjunction with the MLME.

lEEE     21.1.2.4 Service spe cation method The models represented by ﬁgures and state diagrams are intended to be illustrations of the functions provided. It is important to distinguish between a model and a real implementation. The models are optimized for simplicity and clarity of presentation; the actual method of implementation is left to the discretion of the DMG PIIY compliant developer. The service ofa layer or sublayer is the set of capabili es that it offers to a user in the next higher layer [or sublayer). Abstract services are speciﬁed here by describing the service primitives and parameters that characterize each service This deﬁnition is independent ofany particular implementation.
  21.2 DMG PHY service interface  21.2.1 Introduction   The PHY interfaces to the MAC through the TXVECTOR, RXVECTOR, and the PHYCONFICLVECTOR.
 The TXVECTOR supplies the PIIY with per packet transmit parameters. Using the RXVECTOR, the PIIY informs the MAC of the received packet parameters. Using the PllYCONFICLVECTOR, the MAC conﬁgures the PIIY for operation, independent of frame transmission or reception.
   This interface is an extension ofthe generic PIIY service interface deﬁned in 7.3.4.

  21.4.3.3.2 Scrambler  The operation of the scrambler is deﬁned in 21.3.9. Bits x1, x2, x3, x4 of the scrambler shift register are initialized using the bits in the scrambler initialization bits from the header, bits x5, x6, x7 are set to l. The header is scrambled starting from bit 5. The scrambling of the data ﬁeld continues the scrambling of the header with no reset.
  21.4.3.3.3 Encoder  The control PHY header and data is encoded using an effective LDPC code rate less than or equal to V1, generated from the data PHY rate V0 LDPC parity check matrix, with shortening. The following steps are used for the encoding:
  1) L W =168 is the maximal number of data bits in each LDPC codeword. Deﬁne L,,D,,=5 as the length of the header [including header CRC), and Ln“, is the length of the additional data in the header LDPC codeword in octets. Deﬁne the number of header and data bits in the first LDPC codeword as  L,,,,my=(L,,,,R+me)><8=88. The number of LDPC codewords is calculated (Length — 6)><  Nut :1+ 8 . The number of bits in the second and any subsequent codeword [if mu present), except the last, is 1.0”” :[W‘l 1 I” r   2) The number ofbits in the last codeword is deﬁned as LDMW : (Lengrhiﬁbdruvﬂ, 72)><LD,(.W.
3) The output stream of tlie scrambler is broken into blocks of}. = LDYFCW, LDPCW, or LDFLCW bits (depending on the codeword index) such that the m"‘ data word is (b:"",b§””,_..,bz”'7    4) Each data word is padded with zeros to create 504 total bits.
5) To each data word, LCWD parity bits ([7 I‘m ’ , [7 ﬁ’“ p 2”" ) are added to create the  codeword Cm =(blimi’hgny Wino ypgmympilmi )Suchum HM :0_     6) The output is the stream bits generated from the codewords, with the zero padding removed from all codewords.

lEEE  Std 802.11ad-2012    21 1.2.3.2 Scrambler  The operation of the scrambler is defined in 21.3.9. The scrambling of the PSDU continues the scrambling of the header with no reset ofthe scrambler. The padding bits are also scrambled.
  21 1.2.3.3 Encoding  21 .7.2.3.3.1 General  Data is encoded using an outer RS(224,208) block code and a short inner code. The inner code is a (16,8) block code for MCSs 25 and 28, a (12,8) block code for MCSs 26 and 29, and a (9,8) single parity check (SPC) block code for MCSs 27 and 30 and the identity block-code for MCS 31. The encoding is further detailed in the following steps:
  1)  2) 3)  4)  5)  6)  7)   First, the number ofblock padding bits is calculated:
  a) The total number of Reed Solomon codewords is NR5 = [Length/208] and the total number of RS encoded symbols is given by Length + NR5 X 16;  b) After Reed Solomon encoding, the data is encoded with a short block code [N,8) where N  can take one of the following values 8, 9, 12, or 16 depending on the MCS as shown in Table 21-22. Therefore:
  1) The total number ofencoded bits is N” : N x (Length + NR5 x 16); ii) The total number of 512 (in length) blocks (each containing 392 data symbols) is NBLKS = [IVER/("caps X 3931- If BRP PeekCt NBLKS < NELLMIM NBLKS : Nmksium where NBLKS’MW : 18. The total number ofzero block padding bits is NBLK’PAD : NM” X News x 392 7 N35.
  The data is broken into blocks of length 208><8 bits [except for possibly the last block).
  Each block is encoded using the RS(224,208) block code as described in 21.7.2.3.32, except perhaps the last block, which is encoded by a shortened version of the code (i.e., if the last block length is K, the shortened block code is RS(16+K,K).
  The Reed Solomon encoded data stream is further encoded using the block code(N,8) as described in 21 12.3.3.3.
  and  The coded bit stream is concatenated with NBLK PAD zeros. They are scrambled with the continuation of the scrambler sequence that scrambledTlte PSDU input bits.
  Each set of7 octets is interleaved using a uniform interleaver of 7 rows and 8 columns. The 7 octets are written row wise and read column wise ., the index i ofa bit after interleaving is related to the index k ofa bit before interleaving by the following rule:
  i : 8 ><(k1nad7) + flam(k/7),k : 0,1,...,55 where the function f1oor[.) denotes the largest integer not exceeding the function parameter.
   The resulting bit stream is modulated and then blocked as described in 21.7.2.3.4 and 21.7.2.3.5.
      21.7.2.3.3.2 RS encoding  The RS block code is based on the polynomial  16 90:) = Ho: + a") k=1  Where a : 01502 is a root ofthe primitive polynomial p05) : 1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x3.

  21.8 PLCP transmit procedure  The PLCP transmit procedure is shown in Figure 21-18. In order to transmit data, a PIlY-TXSTART.request primitive shall be enabled so that the PIIY entity shall be in the transmit state. Further, the PHY shall be set to operate at the appropriate frequency through station management via the PLME, as speciﬁed in 21.12.
 Other transmit parameters, such as MCS and transmit power, are set via the l’lIY-SAP with the PHY- TXSTART.request(TX\/ECTOR), as described in 21.2.2.
  The PLCP shall then issue a PMDiTXSTARTJ'eunSl primitive, and transmission of the PLCP preamble sliall start, based on the parameters passed in the PllY-TXSTART.request primitive. The preamble format (control PllY, SC or OFDM) depend on the MCS in tlie l’lIYiTXSTARTJeq. The PLCP sliall calculate the length of the packet according the MCS and the length speciﬁed in the PIIYiTXSTARTrequest primitive, adding padding bits if necessary.
  The l’lIY continues with the encoding and transmission of the header according to the PllYiTXSTART.req(TXVECTOR) parameters. The PIlY proceeds with PSDU transmission through a series of data octet transfers from the MAC. The data are encoded as described in 21.4.3.2.3, 21 2.3, and 21.6.3.2.3. The encoded data are then modulated as described in 21.4, 21.5, 21.6, and 21.7, depending on the MCS requested in the PIlYiTXSTARTJeq. Transmission can be prematurely temiinated by the MAC through the primitive PllY—TXEND.request. PIIY-TXSTART shall be disabled by receiving a PIN- TXEND.request primitive.
     Transmission ofthe PSDU is completed with the transmission of the last bits of the (encoded) PSDU. If no TRN-T/R ﬁelds are speciﬁed in the PllY-TXSTART.req, tlie PLCP shall issue PMD-TXEND ailer the transmission of the last bits. If TRN-T and TRN-R are requested in the PIlY-TXSTART.req, the transmission continues witli the transmis ion ofAGC subfields and TRN-T/R subfields. The l’CLP issues the PMD-TXEND alter the transmission of the last TRN-T/R subfield, and then it issues a PllYiTXENDconﬁrm primitive to the MAC. The packet transmission shall be completed, and the PIN entity shall enter the receive state (i.e., PIIYTXSTART shall be disabled). Eacli PllY—TXEND.request primitive is acknowledged with a PIIY-TXEND.conllnn primitive from the PIN.

lEEE ENHANCEMENTS FOR VERY HIGH THROUGHFUT IN THE 60 GHZ BAND Std 802.11ad-2012  21.10 Beamforming 21.10.1 Beamforming concept  Beamforming enables a pair of STAs to train their transmit and receive antennas for subsequent communication. A beamfonned link is established following the successful completion of BF training, which is described iii 9.35.
  DMG STAs use a quasi-omni antenna pattern. The antenna gain of the main beam ofa quasi-omni antenna pattem shall be at most 15 dB lower than the antenna gain iii the main beam for a directional pattern.
  21.10.2 Beamforming PHY frame format  21.10.2.1 TX sector sweep   The packets sent during TX sector sweep are control PIIY packets as deﬁned in 21.4.
21.10.2.2 Beam refinement  21.10.2.2.1 General  Beam refinement is a process where a STA can improve its antenna configuration [or antenna weight vectors) both for transmission and reception. If the SL3 beamfomiing training did not include an RSS, as in the case where both devices have more than one transmit sector per antenna, beam refinement can serve as the first receive antenna configuration training. The procedure of beam refinement is described in 9.35.6.4.
  In the beam refinement procedure, BRP packets are used to train the receiver and transmitter anteiina. There are two types ofBRP packets: BRP-RX packets and BRP-TX packets:
 BRP-RX packets are packets that have TRN-R training sequences appended to them. These packets enable receiver antenna weight vector training.
 BRP-TX packets are packets that have TRN-T training sequences appended to them. The transmitting STA may change antenna configuration at the beginning of each sequence. The receiving STA perfomis measurements on these sequences and sends feedback to the STA that transmits the BRP-TX packet.
  21.10.2.2.2 BRP packet structure  Eacli BRP packet is composed of an STF, a CE field, and a data field followed by a training field containing an AGC training field and a receiver traiiiing field.

lEEE  21.10.2.2.3 BRP packet header fields  The Packet Type and Training Length ﬁelds present within the SC header, control PIIY header, LP SC PIIY header, and OFDM header are used to indicate that a packet is BRP packet and the length of the training Iields, respectively.
   A value oi'OxO in the Packet Type ﬁeld indicates a BRP-RX paeket (TRN-R ﬁeld is present).
  A value oi'Oxl in the Packet Type ﬁeld indicates a BRP-TX packet (TRN-T ﬁeld is present).
  A value oI‘N in the Training Length ﬁeld indicates that the AGC has 4N subﬁelds and that the TRN-R/T ﬁeld has 5N subﬁelds.
  The value N in the Training Length ﬁeld ol‘a BRP-RX packet is equal to the value of the L-RX ﬁeld requested by the intended reeeiver 0111K: BRP-RX packet at a previously received BRP Request ﬁeld (see 751.4).
  21.10.2.2.4 BRP packet duration  The minimum duration ol‘tlie data ﬁeld oi'a BRP paeket when sent in an SC PIIY is aBRPminSCbloeks SC bloeks (see 21 .6.3.2.5) and, it'needed, the data ﬁeld of the packet shall be extended by extra zero padding to generate the required number of SC bloeks. Table 21-23 contains the values of Ncwmm tor eaeli MCS necessary to compute the padding described in 21.6.3133.

  21.10.2.2.5 Beam refinement AGC field  The beam reﬁnement AGC ﬁelds are composed o1~ 4N repetitions of the sequence [Ga64 Ga64 Ga64 Ga64 Gam] when the packet is transmitted using the OFDM or SC PHY and [Gbﬁ4 Gb64 Gb64 be>1 Gbm] when the packet is transmitted using the control PIIY. The sequences Gab4 and Gb64 are deﬁned in 21.11. The sequences are transmitted using rotated n/Z-BPSK modulation. Any transmit signal transients that occur due to this TX AWV conﬁguration change shall completely settle by the end of the ﬁrst Ga64 or Gb64 subsequence.
  In a BRP-TX packet, the transmitter may change the TX AWV conﬁguration at the beginning of each AGC subﬁeld. The set o1~ AWVs used [or the AGC subﬁelds should be the same as that used for the TRN»T subﬁelds. In a BRP-RX packet, the transmitter shall use the same TX AWV as in the preamble and data ﬁelds of the packet.
  21.10.2.2.6 Beam refinement TRN-R field   The TRN-R ﬁelds enable receiver AWV training. The TRN-R ﬁelds have the form shown in Figure 21-23.

The 4N subﬁelds R1 through R4), each consist of the sequence [Galzx -Gblzx Galzx Gblzx Galzx]. The sequences Galzx and Gblzx are deﬁned in Table 21-24 and Table 21-25, respectively, in 21.11. The sequences are transmitted using rotated n/Z-BPSK modulation.
  21.10.2.2.7 Beam refinement TRN-T field  The TRN-T lield enables transmitter AWV training. The TRN-T ﬁelds have the [orm shown in Figure 21- 24.

The 4N subﬁelds Tl through T4N each consist of the sequence [Ga128 >Gblzx Galzx Gblzx Galzx]. The sequences Gal28 and Gb128 are deﬁned in Table 21-24 and Table 21-25, respectively, in 21.11. The sequences are transmitted using rotated n/Z-BPSK modulation. When transmitting the CE subﬁeld, the transmitter shall use the same AWV as in the preamble and data ﬁelds of the packet. Any transmit signal transients that occur due to TX AWV conﬁguration changes between subﬁelds shall settle by the end of the ﬁrst 64 samples of the subﬁeld.
  21.10.2.2.8 Channel measurement  The good autocorrelation properties of the Golay sequence enable reconstructing part of the impulse response of the channel between the transmitter and the receiver. The receiver should ﬁnd the tap with largest amplitude in the channel during the CE ﬁeld ol'the BRP-RX. It selects thereafter the set of taps that is measured around the tap with the largest amplitude, according to the value of dotl 1ChanMCasFBCKNtaps. It can select a contiguous set of taps or select a noncontiguous set ol‘taps,  Copyrlght© 2012 IEEE. All rlgl't's reserved, 489

It then measures the phase and amplitude ofthe corresponding channel taps in each ofthe TRN»T ﬁeld repetition (except for those using the CE AWV conﬁguration). The beam reﬁnement feedback subﬁeld k7] is the relative amplitude and phase of this tap in the k '2}: repetition compared to this tap in the ﬁrst TRN-T subiield.
  21.10.2.2.9 BRP resampling in an OFDM packet  The BRP AGC, CE, and Tn/Rn ﬁelds are speciﬁed at the SC chip rate (TE). When appended to an OFDM packet, the signal is resampled as deﬁned in 21.3.3.2.
  21.11 Golay sequences  The following Golay sequences are used in the preamble, in the single carrier guard interval and in beam reﬁnement TRN»R/T and AGC Iields: Ga123(n), Gblzxm), Ga64(n), Gb64[n), Ga32(n), Gb32(n). These are 3 pairs of complementary sequences. The subscript denotes the length of the sequences. These sequences are generated using the following recursive procedure:

  L4 DMG example data vectors  Subclauses L.5 to L.8 contain example data vectors for the DMG PIlY (see Clause 21). All ot'the example data text ﬁles referenced by these subclauses are contained in a single ZIP ﬁle, DMGEncodingExamples.zip, that is embedded in document 11-12/0751r0 (see https://mentor.ieee.org/ 802.11/dcn/12/l1-12-075l-OO-OOad-dme-encodin -examnles.docx).
  For each described node there is a cross-reference in this annex that is of the form Reference: <ﬁlename.txt> where the named text ﬁle is one of the ﬁles in the ZIP ﬁle embedded in 1 1-12/0751r0.
   Depending on the node being illustrated, the text ﬁle may represent bit data, symbol data, or sample data:
 For bit data, the text ﬁle contains a time ordered sequence of l and 0 characters, separated by spaces and without any carriage control characters.
  For symbol data, the text ﬁle contains a time ordered sequence of signed integers, separated by spaces and without any carriage control characters.
  For sample data, the text ﬁle contains a time ordered sequence of complex values, formatted as i<rea1>i<imag>j, separated by spaces and without any carriage control characters.
  When referencing speciﬁc bits, symbols, or samples in the ﬁles, they are considered to be numbered starting from 1.
  This fomtatting of the text ﬁles has been chosen to facilitate import into other tools. For example, the ﬁles can be read using the MATLAB dlmread ( ' filename ' ) command.
  For CPHY, SC PIlY and low-power (LP) SC PIlY modulation samples, no spectrum shaping has been applied to the data because the implementation of spectrum shaping is not deﬁned in this standard. For OFDM PIIY modulation samples, no symbol shaping has been applied to the data because the implementation ot'OFDM symbol shaping is not deﬁned in this standard.

For this example, with a payload of 120 octets, LDPFCW : 88, LDFCW = 152 and LDPLCW = 152.
 These numbers illustrate that the payload is not simply packed 168 hits at a time tnto the LDPC encoding, with the last few btts (modulo 168) in the last packet getting disproportionate codtng gain. The speciﬁed calculation ensures that the excess codtng gain is spread evenly across all the packets, so the number of payload btts in each packet varies between approximately 120 and the maximum 168.

  Annex Y  (informative)  Functions of the centralized coordination service root (CCSR)  Via unspecified means over the DS, a centralized coordination service root (CCSR) performs the following functions:
   Allows APs to enroll or uiienroll from the CCSS.
Provides a directory service, wherein the CCSR responds to a Directory Service request that  includes a MAC address with an indication of' whether the MAC address is an S-AP within the CCSS.
  Conﬁgures the beacon interval, ClusterMaxMem, Beacon SP duration , TXSS Offset, TXSS CBAP Duration, and TXSS CBAP MaxMein [see 9.34.2.2) of' each S-AP.
   Aligns the rate of increment of‘TSFs of S-APs within the CCSS.
  Conﬁgures the individual TSF offsets of each S-AP in order to minimize the temporal, spatial, and frequency overlap of‘BIIIs ofthe 853s in the same CCSS.
  Provides to each S-AP the Cluster Time Offset availability information from nearby co-channel S-Aps.
  Configures each S-AP with certain medium access policies for its centralized PCP/AP cluster [see 9.34.3.4). The CCSR is permitted to configure different S-APs with different medium access policies.
  Configures each S-AP with a list of' one or more channels in an Operating Class that the S-AP is excluded from operating upon and that the S-AP advertises via the Channel Usage procedures [see 10.23.14). The excluded channels are available to STAs that are operating in the area covered by the ECPAC, yet are not within the ECPAC.
